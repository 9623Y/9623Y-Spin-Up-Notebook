# ***SpinUp1WeekBuild-DesignContest***




## **5/11/22 - _The Contest Begins_**

Tonight a one week build and design contest to see who can build the best disc launcher for Spin Up was announced in out Robotics team Discord server. We began working on designs as soon as we saw the announcement.


### **The Challenge**

The main challenge with designing a good launcher is finding a balance between spinning the discs enough so that they are able to keep balanced throughout their flight and provided the discs with enough forward momentum so that the discs are able to reach the high goal, another challenge that will be faced is finding the optimial angle to launch the discs at, launch at too steep of an angle and the disc is going straight over the high goal, launch at too shallow of an angle and that disc is going right into the enemies low goal.


### **Criteria for an optimal launcher**

- Be able to spin the discs enough to keep them balanced in air
- Launch the Discs at an acceptable velocity
- Have some type of resivor to hold the 3 disc capacity
- Some sort of pusher arm to feed the discs from the resivor into the flywheel(s)
- Be compact enough to allow for an intake while still being functional


### **Possible Designs for Launchers**

- 2L1R (2 Left 1 Right) Flywheel System
  - A Flywheel system with two Flywheels on the left side and one flywheel on the right side, the first flywheel on the left side works to induce spin and feed the second set of flywheels which give the disc it's forward momentum. The spin induced by the first flywheel by having the flywheel on the same side as the first flywheel spining faster than the flywheel opposite from it.
- 2L0R (2 Left 0 Right) Flywheel System
  - A flywheel system that works by using two flywheels on one side with none on the other side that both spin the disc as well as give the disc a decent amount of forward momentum by using the wall on the side opposite to help guide the disc straight
- 1L1R (1 Left 1 Right) Flywheel System
  - A flywheel system that uses two flywheels on each side spining in opposite directions to propel the disc forward, with this method spin on the disc is induced by one flywheel spining faster than the other.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

It's getting rather late to continue, so we will continue on tomorrow. Tomorrow we will begin mock designs of the differnt possible designs for the Launcher in Fusion as well as expand further with any new ideas or additions to past ideas.

## **5/12/2022 - _Beginning Design_**

Today we will begin working on concept designs of the possible designs that were mentioned last night. First we will do a diagram of how the flywheel system should work in theory, then we will begin to design the launchers more indepth in Fusion 360, so we will be able to build the launchers physically easily because we can just copy the in-depth designs from Fusion 360.


### **Goals for Today**

- [x] Diagram how the 2L1R system will work
- [x] Diagram how the 2L0R system will work
- [x] Diagram how the 1L1R system will work
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 2L1R system in Fusion 360
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 2L0R system in Fusion 360
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 1L1R system in Fusion 360


### **Diagrams of the Different Possible Flywheel Systems**

In the diagrams the black arrows represent the direction of spin of the flywheels(the grey circles), while the red arrows represent the effect that the flywheels had on the disc(yellow circles). In the case of the black arrows, the larger the arrow the faster the flywheels are spinning. In the case of the red arrows, the larger the arrow the greater the effect the flywheels are having on the the disc.

### **End of Entry thoughts**

Today I was able to get the Diagrams for each type of flywheel system made and put it to the notebook, however I ran out of time to begin working on the in-depth designs of each flywheel system because I was helping with the creation of a Fusion 360 library that has every VRC legal part in it as well as every size piece of metal available. This parts library is to help save our robotics teams time when they model their robot in CAD.
