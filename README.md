# ***Team Bio***




# ***Game Explanation***
This year the competition is titled VEX: Spin-Up

The field will be divided diagonally into two halves. Robots will be attempting to score discs from the field into the high goals and low goals. There is only 1 high goal and 1 low goal assigned to each allience, with a disc scored in the high goal being worth 5 points and a disc in the low goal being worth 1 point. Teams can use the temporary unlimited horizontal expansion limit in the last 10 seconds to cover as many tiles as possible and earn an additional 3 points for each tile covered. There are a total of 36 tiles on the field and both teams can be awarded points for touching the same tile. Each covered tile is worth 3 points. Teams can also use the robots to change the color of the rollers to their assigned alliance color to gain 10 points for each roller owned by their alliance. There are a total of 4 rollars around the field that either alliance can score. Teams can also gain points from the autonomous driving period. Whichever team completes the autonomous period tasks will be awarded the 10 autonomous bonus points.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/196194837-514300cb-4613-436a-89bc-c94df2e87edb.png" height = "250">
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/196195898-4993a281-fc40-453b-894e-de4e4478d20a.png" height = "250">

The match will start with a 15 second autonomous period followed by a driver controlled period lasting a minute and 45 seconds. All game rules are in effect during both the autonomous period and the driver controlled period, though manually driving the bot using the contoller is not allowed during the autonomous period. Teams are given 2 preloadable discs per team before the match and 7 match discs per alliance teams can add onto the field using a metal ramp along the sides of the field. 

During the match, each robot can only hold at most 3 discs at a time. Theres is a vertical and horizontal limit of 18 inches during the match. There is a 24 inch height limit, but its limited to a vertical cylinder with a 2" diameter. This year, teams are not allowed to trap a robot in any way, including blocking a robot from moving on its intended path. Trapping for 5 seconds or more will penalize the team on the offense. Any less than 5 seconds and the opposing team will be given the benefit of the doubt.

The robot can only use 8 motors and 2 pneumatic resivoirs, each capped at 100 Psi. No external tampering with any electronic devices is allowed.

## ***Scoring***

|Scoring Objective| Points Rewarded |
| :---: | :---: |
|Disc Scored in High Goal| 5 points|
|Disc Scored in Low Goal| 1 point|
|Owned Roller| 10 points|
|Each Covered Field Tile| 3 points|
|Winner of Autonomus Bonus| 10 points|

## ***Field Elements***
In Spin Up, there are 4 unique field elements consisting of the High Goals, Low Goal barriers, Rollers, and Discs.

### ***High Goals***
The High Goals can be found in opposing corners of the field and sit on bars attached to the outer walls of the field. They can be found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance scores in each High Goal. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/196198613-301018af-5adb-433d-b4be-32aa60684321.png" height = "250">

Each High Goal has a lower basket with a bar through the middle. The bar holds up a thin, plastic disc that hold the chains, and the chains themselves. These chains are used to help catch the disc and give it a better chance at making it into the basket. 

The High Goal itself only sits at 14.1". The supporting bar defintily add a new level of difficulty to the game as the bar sits 18.5" above the field. This added height lifts the base of the lower basket to 21.4" off the field.. The outer lip of the basket sits roughly 25" above the field with the highest point of the High Goal contraption sitting 35.5" off the field.

These goals are made for robots to shoot discs into the lower basket and gives 5 points for each disc sucessfully landed into the basket.

### ***Low Goals***
The Low Goals can be found under each High Goal and uses a slightly raised ramp to separate the goal area from the rest of the field. The two ramps are found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance scores in each Low Goal. Each alliance's Low Goal is located under the opposing alliance's High Goal. 

Each Low Goal consists of a ramp and a small portion of the field blocked off within that ramp. The ramp sits with an incline towards the outside of the Low Goal, allowing robots easy access out of the goal but difficulty getting in.

The Low Goal ramps are roughly a little more than 1 tile wide on each side in an L shape, hugging the corner of the outermost tile. The Low Goal area only takes up 4 tiles underneath the High Goal.

The way these goals are set up allows missed shots into the High Goals to become points for the opposing teams. Each disc into this goal is only 1 point.

### ***Rollers***
The Rollers can be found in the two corners unused by the High Goals. They sit on the outer walls of the field and they spin between red and blue, a color for each alliance. There are a total of 4 rollers, which are all identical.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/196445931-16101aba-ba2a-4913-9eec-9a51deab7cd0.jpg" height = "250">

Each Roller has a spinning tube colored half blue and half red. The plastic parts on either side hold the Roller to the wall and allow the tube to spin. The tubes have two bolts in the middle of each color on the far left and right of the tubes. The arms on either side of the plastic pointing towards the tube catch on the bolts. This system helps teams who are able to push the Roller hard enough to catch between these arms and prevent other teams who don't have that strength from switching it to another color.

The tube of the Rollers is 9.80". The outer plastic walls holding the tube to the wall make the entire Roller 13.15". The middle of the Roller sits 13.85" above the field, with the highest point reaching 15.23" above the field. Each Roller sits 2.85" from the wall.

These Rollers allow teams to gain 10 points if their color is shown between the arms. Some teams won't have the mechanics needed to spin the Rollers, giving the teams that do an advantage. It can give teams with stronger contraptions an even bigger advantage to other teams that can't spin the roller hard enough to push the bolt under the arms.

### ***Discs***
The Discs are found scattered across the field. They can be moved around on the field and are only found in one color: yellow. Both alliances are able to pick up and use all of the discs no matter where they are on the field, as long as the robots can reach them. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/196459608-e61025e5-7a79-4dd0-bb37-9aabb23c3a00.png" height = "250">

Each Disc is a flat circle with a raised lip around the edge. Robots can pick them up and fling them at High Goals, or toss and/or push them into Low Goals to score them. Each robot can only hold 3 discs at a time and more discs can be added through the Loader at any time in the match. 

The Discs have a total diameter of 5.51" with a +-0.13" tolerance. Each Disc has a total width of 0.79" with a +-0.02" tolerance.

The Discs by themselves won't score any points, but they can be used to score points in the two different goals.

# **5/11/22 - _The Contest Begins_**

Tonight a one week build and design contest to see who can build the best disc launcher for Spin Up was announced in out Robotics team Discord server. We began working on designs as soon as we saw the announcement.

## **The Challenge**

The main challenge with designing a good launcher is finding a balance between spinning the discs enough so that they are able to keep balanced throughout their flight and provided the discs with enough forward momentum so that the discs are able to reach the high goal, another challenge that will be faced is finding the optimial angle to launch the discs at, launch at too steep of an angle and the disc is going straight over the high goal, launch at too shallow of an angle and that disc is going right into the enemies low goal.


## **Criteria for an optimal launcher**

- Be able to spin the discs enough to keep them balanced in air
- Launch the Discs at an acceptable velocity
- Have some type of resivor to hold the 3 disc capacity
- Some sort of pusher arm to feed the discs from the resivor into the flywheel(s)
- Be compact enough to allow for an intake while still being functional


## **Possible Designs for Launchers**

- 2L1R (2 Left 1 Right) Flywheel System
  - A Flywheel system with two Flywheels on the left side and one flywheel on the right side, the first flywheel on the left side works to induce spin and feed the second set of flywheels which give the disc it's forward momentum. The spin induced by the first flywheel by having the flywheel on the same side as the first flywheel spining faster than the flywheel opposite from it.
- 2L0R (2 Left 0 Right) Flywheel System
  - A flywheel system that works by using two flywheels on one side with none on the other side that both spin the disc as well as give the disc a decent amount of forward momentum by using the wall on the side opposite to help guide the disc straight
- 1L1R (1 Left 1 Right) Flywheel System
  - A flywheel system that uses two flywheels on each side spining in opposite directions to propel the disc forward, with this method spin on the disc is induced by one flywheel spining faster than the other.


## **End of Entry Thoughts**

It's getting rather late to continue, so we will continue on tomorrow. Tomorrow we will begin mock designs of the differnt possible designs for the Launcher in Fusion as well as expand further with any new ideas or additions to past ideas.



-----



# **5/12/2022 - _Beginning Design_**

Today we will begin working on concept designs of the possible designs that were mentioned last night. First we will do a diagram of how the flywheel system should work in theory, then we will begin to design the launchers more indepth in Fusion 360, so we will be able to build the launchers physically easily because we can just copy the in-depth designs from Fusion 360.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Diagram how the 2L1R system will work
- [x] Diagram how the 2L0R system will work
- [x] Diagram how the 1L1R system will work
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 2L1R system in Fusion 360
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 2L0R system in Fusion 360
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 1L1R system in Fusion 360


## **Diagrams of the Different Possible Flywheel Systems**

In the diagrams the black arrows represent the direction of spin of the flywheels(the grey circles), while the red arrows represent the effect that the flywheels had on the disc(yellow circles). In the case of the black arrows, the larger the arrow the faster the flywheels are spinning. In the case of the red arrows, the larger the arrow the greater the effect the flywheels are having on the the disc.

## **End of Entry thoughts**

Today I was able to get the Diagrams for each type of flywheel system made and put it to the notebook, however I ran out of time to begin working on the in-depth designs of each flywheel system because I was helping with the creation of a Fusion 360 library that has every VRC legal part in it as well as every size piece of metal available. This parts library is to help save our robotics teams time when they model their robot in CAD.

# **5/16/2022 - _Fusion Design Begins_**

Today, Me(Rhett) and Tyler, are going to begin designing our prototype launchers in Fuison. The First Design we will do in Fusion is the 2L1R Launcher, then we will move on to the 2L0R and 1L1R Launchers if time allows today. The main Goal today is to get the 2L1R Launcher fully built in Fusion so that we can hopefully get it completely built in one team meeting tomorrow then we can begin on the other two designs.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Begin to Design the 2L1R Launcher in Fusion
- [ ] (If time)Begin to design the 2L0R Launcher in Fusion
- [ ] (If time)Begin to design the 1L1R Launcher in Fusion


## **Designing of the 2L1R Launcher**

### **The Ramp**

The Ramp is made of 3 1x5x1x22 Steel C-Channels and 2 1x2x1x22 Alumnium C-Channel being is held together by 32 Star drive #8-32 x 1/4" screws with Nylon Nuts on them. We chose this design because the 5 wide C-Channels allow for enough space for the disc and flywheels and the 2 wide C-Channel gives a place to mount the flywheels and motors with a gear ration on.

### **The Flywheels and their Gear Ratios**

For the Gear Ratio we are using a 1:10 Ratio with at Green Motor. We chose this Ratio because we will be able to dial back the speed from the full speed to the target speeds of 1600 and 1500 RPM and because the motors aren't running at full force they will be under less strain meaning they are less prone to overheatings, and with the two different sides of the flywheel system spinning at different speeds, because we are tuning the speed of the motor down with the code, we can use the same gear ratio on both sides, this will also make it easier to sync up the motors if we want to be able to control the speed of the flywheels mid match.

#### **Diagram of the Gear Ratio for the Flywheels**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102620185/168694547-b73bff81-094d-4452-94c5-6e3d00ecba0f.png)

#### **Further explaination of the Gear Ratio**
Both sides will have the same gear ratio but on the left side where there is two motors, following the 12 tooth pinion gear in the 1:5 ratio a series of 1:1 ratios will continue that motion to the second flywheel. This means that the Flywheel system only needs 2 motors instead of 3 meaning we have 1 motor to allocate else where.


## **End of Entry Thoughts**
I was unable to get the 2L1R Launcher Fully Designed in Fusion today, I'm hoping to be able to finish it tomorrow morning before we meet for Robotics, today was very productive however as we were able to figure the Gear ration for the flywheels and have come up with a game plan of how to design it.




-----




# **5/17/2022 - _Design Continues and Building Begins_**

Today we are going to have the first meeting since the build and design contest began meaning that we will able to begin to build our prototype launchers today. However before the meeting today I'm going to try and design the rest of the prototype launcher before we have our meeting today. If I'm able to get the design finished in Fusion before the meeting we will be able to easily build the prototype and possibly begin coding today. When I(Rhett) got  into class today I began to talk with Mr.Holmes about the next step, he said before we begin to work on a launcher we should do tests to figure out what the best rpm to launch the discs at are and make tables to show that data, instead of just designing off of what we guess will work the best. He also suggested to use blue gearboxes for the motors so we would need less of a gear ratio to get to our target rpm to reduce friction in between the gears. So instead of finsihing the design for the launcher we began working on a prototyping bed to run our tests on.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Begin Designing a prototype bed in Fusion
- [x] Begin Prototyping
- [x] (If time) Program the Prototype

## **Designing of the Prototyping Bed**

### **The Base for the 1L1R prototype**

The Base is made up of a 15x30 Steel Base Plate and two 1x2x1x30 Aluminum C-Channels and held together by 8 #8-32 x 1/4" screws with Nylock Nuts on them. We chose to use nylocks so that the basee would be sturdy enough so that it would be able to produce consistent tests while we try different rpms to fire the discs at. This Base is going to be the foundation for all the test we do with the 1L1R System  to find what the best RPM for the flywheels to run at is. Two of these bases can belinked together to get the base used for the 2L1R Prototype.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**

Overall today was very productive and I feel like we mad great progress on our prototyping bed, tomorrow we will hopefully be able to finish designing the beds and get them put together so that we can begin testing either tomorrow or Thursday. I think that these prototypes and test will be very helpful to our final design because it will allow up to go into beginning our design for the launcher on our robot knowing what works and what the best format for the launcher will be.

# **5/18/2022 - _Prototyping Continues_**

Today we will continue prototyping with the same Design as yesterday. The first thing to work on today is a pnuematic pusher to feed the discs into the flywheels so we can get consistent test results. Then if time allows we can begin to work on designing the different tests for the different speeds we could possibly use for our flywheels.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Design the Pnuematic Pusher
- [ ] (If Time) Began to create a formulated test for rpm to run the flywheels at
- [ ] (If Time) Work on a Universal Gear Ratio to test the different RPMs at
- [ ] (If Time) Begin testing


## **Designing of the 1L1R Prototyping Bed(_Cont._)**


### **The Pnuematic Pusher**

This Pnuematic pusher will allow us to consistantly push the disc in a way that will provide accurate results when we test the effectiveness of the flywheels running at different speeds.


##### **The Mount**

The Mount for the pnuematic piston has to be extremely sturdy because we dont want the piston to be able to move around when firing it because it would throw off the results of our tests.

##### **The Mounting Point**

The mounting point that we will mount the cylinder to is a Bevel Gearbox screwed into our base plate as far back as possible. We chose to use a bevel gearbox to mount the pneumatic piston to because it is small enough to not take up too much room on our prototyping bed while still being sturdy enough so that it won't move around while firing. This gearbox is screwed into the bed with 2 #8-32 x 3/8" screws with Nylocks on them.

##### **Mounting the Cylinder**

The Cylinder is mounted to the gearbox with the standard cylinder mounting bracket, attached to cylinder with a #8-32 x 7/8" screw with a nylock nut, screwed into the bottom row of the gearbox with two #8-32 x 1/4" screws held and nylock nuts. We chose this mounting format because it places the cylinder at about the center of the disc width and height wise meaning that it will be able to consistently push the disc straight into the flywheels.

##### **Rod Guide**

Even though the piston would work to push the discs in its current state, a rod guide that doubles as a support for the cylinder and triples as the back of a place to set the disc. The rod guide will be a piece of 10 long 2x2 Aluminum angle, this will have 1 piece of 10 long 2x2 Aluminum angle on either side to act as the disc guide as well. These pieces of 2x2 Aluminum angle are each held down by two #8-32 x 3/8" screws with Nylock nuts. We opt'ed to use Nylock nuts so that we can ensure that the Angle pieces aren't able to move around and are very steady so that we can get consistent test results.


##### **Issue**

While looking at spacing for a prototype I built to base my fusion design off of the cylinder bore looks a good bit shorter in Fusion than it is in real life. So just in case it is I'm going to wait until I can check and see whether or not the cylinder bore in Fusion is a different length than the actual physical cylinder bore because if the lengths are different the designs could very in spacing greatly between Fusion and real life.


## **End of Entry Thoughts**

It's quite unfortunate that there is potentially a spacing issue because I would have like to get a prototyping bed close to fully built in Fusion tonight. At least I have a pnuematic pusher designed physically and built and I just need to wait and see if lengths are correct for the cylinder bores and if I need to alter the design to accomodate for any potential differences. Since I can't really work on designs until I know what my spacing is for the pnuematic pusher, I would like to begin tomorrow by working on forumalating a test for the different RPM Speeds and work on figuring out a gear ratio that will work universally for all the different RPMs so we dont have to constantly change gear ratios on the prototyping bed.




---------




# **5/19/2022 - _Designing a Test_**

Today we will work on coming up with a test to test the different RPMs that we could run the launcher at so that we can figure out what the most optimal RPM for the flywheels are. We will also work to come up with a gear ratio that we think will impact the speed of the flywheels after a disc is launched the least and that will get us to all the different RPMs we want through chaning the code.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Come up with a test that we can use to Test the different RPMs for the flywheels
- [x] Come up with requirements for a gear ratio to use with the test


### **The Test**

For our test we will start out at 600 RPM for each motor and then gradually increase the RPM of each motor by intervals of 100 each time up to 6000 rpm, for each different rpm we will shoot ten discs and average their distance together for our data entry, each set of ten will be done with a fully charged battery and a full cylinder at 100 psi, this test will give us a good base line for how each different RPM combination preforms and then we will be able to test the RPMs with the best result with the different flex wheel hardnesses to figure out what hardness will work the best, we might also look at combining different hardnesses of Flex Wheels.


### **Gear Ratio to Test With**

For a Gear Ratio to test with we were thinking about using a 1:10 gear ratio potentially using 5 gears, we chose to use 5 gears because it would transfer less energy to the motor, which means less wear on the motor as well as the motor will be able to spin back up to speed faster, which means we can shoot at a faster rate. This Gear Ratio will allow use to get all of the speeds we want for the flywheels with one gear ratio and the use of selecting the speed in the code. We will work to design a Gear Ratio that fits these requirements tomorrow.


## **End of Entry Thoughts**

Althought we didn't do much today, today's discussion about what the test should look like and what kind of gear ratio we think would work the best, this discussion helped us layout how our next week or so will look and what we need to do to test everything properly and get the best idea of what will be most effective for our launcher on our robot when we begin buildin



-------




# **5/20/2022 - _Gear Ratios_**

Today we are going to took at all the different gear ratios and come up with a compound gear ratio that can get us up to our desired RPM target, this Gear Ratio may only be for testing and we come up with a gear ratio that puts us closer to our ideal RPM for our flywheels or this gear ratio may be implemented into our actually launcher if it performs well enough.


## **Goals For Today**

- [x] Make a Table of all Possible Simple Gear Ratios
- [x] Look at all 1:10 Compound Gear Ratios
- [x] Pick a Gear Ratio out of the different possible 1:10 Gear Ratio


## **Taking a look at all possible Simple Gear Ratios**

## **1:10 Gear Ratio Chosen for Prototyping bed**

When I got into class Tyler and our other friend Alex who is helping us with this bed had been working on it and had decided on a 1:10 Gear Ratio that used a 48T Gear Driven by the motor to a 24T Gear on an axle with a 60T Gear that was driving a 12T Gear. This Gear Ratio was chosen because it gives us a ceiling of 6000 RPM and will allow us to test a wide range of different RPMs. We chose 6000 RPMs as our ceiling because of tests I've seen online that use 3000 RPM Flywheels that are unable to consistently score from the opposite side of the field which gives me an estimate that the ideal gear ratio will be somewhere around 4500 RPM but may be higher than that or maybe even lower than that.


## **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today I'm happy with what we got done and we will hopefully be able to get a program written on Monday and begin testing either Monday or Tuesday to get our Results and begin to test other things, our test will most likely be done 3 times for each type of flywheel system so that we can test the best hardness of the flex wheels for each flywheel type.




-------




# **5/23/2022 - _Programming and Maybe Testing_**

Today we will look at getting a program written for our prototyping bed that will output the RPMs of the flywheels to an array so we can import the data into a spredsheet and look at a graph of how the disc going through the flywheels affects the RPM of the flywheel and how long it takes the flywheels to get back up to full speed. Once this is done we will potentially be able to start testing. However we might run out of time and not be able to begin testing today.


## **Goals for Today**

- [ ] Write a Program for the test bed
- [ ] (If Time) Collect the Data from the Program and graph it
- [ ] (If Time) Begin testing


## **What The Program should be able to do**

The Program for the test bed should be able to have the flywheel speed be able to be independantly controlled with a controller and be able to fire a disc with the press of a button on the controller by acuating a pnuematic piston. This code also needs to be able to output the speed of the flywheels to an array that expands as much as needed.


## **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we weren't able to get the program working but we will begin with that tomorrow and hopefully be able to get a program that will allow use to visualize the data recieved from the encoders on the flywheels.




------




# **5/24/2022 - _Programming and Working Towards Finalizing the Prototyping/Test Bed_**

Today we will work on getting a program that reliably collects data from the rotational sensors on the flywheels. Once that is done we will begin to try and finalize our design for the test bed so that we can begin testing.

## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Get the Program for the Test Bed Written
- [x] Begin Working towards finalizing the design of the prototyping bed
- [ ] (If Time) Begin Testing


## **Finalizing the Testing/Prototyping Bed Design**

### **The Pnuematic Pusher**

We decided to redesign the pusher on our pneumatic piston because the old one was causing the disc to be pressed down in the back which popped the front of the disc up instead of the disc being pushed straight through the flywheels like intended

- Image of New Pneumatic Pusher Device


<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102620185/171167628-6cb88f8b-64e3-406a-8b0f-cd6a603b9734.jpg" height = "500">

### **The Bed**

#### **Flexing Issues**

There was alot of flexing in the c-channels that held our gear ratios and had our motors and flywheels mounted to them, this flexing was causing deflection in the flywheels whenever attempting to fire a disc, to fix this issue of flexing we opted to add another base plate the is screwed in between the bottom c-channels, this made our rig very rigid and almost completely prone to any kind of flexing.


#### **Disc Hitting the Flywheels too low**

Our discs were coming through the flywheels towards the bottom which was causing the flywheels to try and ride over the disc, instead of raising the whole base plate or lowering the flyhweels we opted to add 3 layers of plexiglass for the disc to rest on so that the discs would ride up higher and be pushed through the middle of the flywheels instead of almost under the flywheel. To keep from having to raise everything on the back of the test bed up we decided to mount the pusher device higher in relation to the height of the piston so that it wouldn't have to be moved up.

- Image of Solution for the discs hitting the Flywheel too low

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102620185/171167484-1d1cb8a3-f15e-46c1-8ab6-5ada45500a67.jpg" height = "500">


## **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we began working on finalizing the design of our prototyping bed which means that we are getting close to being able to test our first type of flywheel system and begin to gather data on what will work and what won't work.




--------




# **5/25/2022 - _Continuing Work on the Test Bed_**

Today we will continue working on the finalization of our design for the Test bed by fixing some minor issues that came with the design changes yesterday, as well as converting to high strength axles to drive the flywheels, and better securing the test bed together by making it more rigid.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Fix some Minor Issues that came with yesterdays design changes
- [x] Make the test bed even more rigid
- [x] Begin converting to High Strength Axles


## **Finalizing the Testing/Prototyping Bed Design(_Cont._)**

### **The Pnuematic Pusher (_Cont._)**

When we went to mount the pneumatic pusher we designed yesterday we found out that there were some fitment issues and that we need to change the support for the piston as well as raise the mounting bracket one row of holes from the bottom row to the second row of holes on it's mounting plate.

- Image of Pnuematic Pusher Mount

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102620185/171167272-6c0dc82e-38db-4b2a-88d9-b2c40d027b10.jpg" height = "500"> 


### **Bed Rigidity**

Our bed was more than likely already rigid enough but when the base plate connecting the bottom c-channels got put in it was no square with the c-channels and was causing mounting issues. In our move to High Strength axles we swapped the 2 wide c-channel we had on the sides out for 3 wide c-channel to give enough room to the high strength axles and their bearing blocks. When we took apart the bed to re-level it we decided to add more standoffs to create more support for the beds and c-channels this means that the bed will be more stable and have less flexing issues.

### **Conversion to High Strength Axles**

We also decide to convert the axles for the flywheel system to high strength axles because they are going to be what we most likely use in our actual robot so we need to run all of our tests using them, this will allow us to have accurate data to base our robot off of. We chose to use high strength axles because they are less likely to bend and twist that the low strength axles and flex less than the low strength axles.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we got a lot done and we are very close to being able to begin testing to figure out what will work the best for our flywheels. I am very happy with the progress we made today and feel like the we will be able to get the testing done and begin looking at intakes very shortly.




-------




# **5/26/2022 - _Testing Begins_**

Today we're gong to finish converting our test bed to high strength axles. Once we finish converting the test bed we can begin testing and collecting data on rpm values and how long the flywheel takes to get back up to the set rpms after a disc is launched through it.

## **Goals For Today**

- [x] Convert test bed to high strength axles.
- [x] Collect data on different rpm values.
- [x] Measure and record how long it takes for the flywheel to get back up to speed after a disc is fired

## **Analysis of Data**


#### **Test 1 Graph**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102620185/171165553-177020b7-27bb-41ac-a13a-69132239f64f.png)

Looking at the graph it's apparent that the flywheels take around 2 seconds to spin up to our desired rpms. After the desired rpm is reached it tends to fluctuate above or below our target speed by up to 50 rpm.

### **Test 2 Graph**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102620185/171165650-8db16ba6-cbae-49ef-8594-a650941eeab9.png)

In this test we reduced the speed of the left flywheel to create a horizontal disc spin to prevent wobble and make shots more accurate. The left flywheel is spinning at 1500 rpm while the right is spinning at 2000 rpm. The left motor didn't take as long to reach it's full speed but the diffrence seems almost negligible. When we shot a disc through the flywheel the right one lost more speed, losing around 600 while the left motor lost around 250. The recovery time was also much shorter on our left flywheel, being around half a second while the right flywheel took around a second to recover. While I expected there to be a diffrence in the rpm loss and recovery time was to be expected, it was a surpise to me that the diffrence in numbers was that large.

## **End Of Entry Thoughts**

The data we are collecting today is crucial for the design of our bot and the overall outcome of our team this season. I'm glad we are figuring this data out now to implement on the bot later. I'm very happy with the test bed and the kind of crucial data it's been able to provide us. Now that we've finished designing the test bed, we can run all the different tests we need to collect even more data that will help in the designing of our bot. Tests we'll be running are things like what hardness of flex wheels is best for distance and accuracy, how combinging wheels affects our results, what kind of grarbox/rpm is optimal for our goal, what the best angle to shoot from is and what can be done to reduce time required to get the flywheel back up to speed.




------




# **5/27/2022 - _Heavily Testing_**

Today we will begin testing all of the things in our end of entry thoughts from yesterday as well as many other new things such as will the motors be able to run at full speed for the entire match without losing performance.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Test Different RPM Combinations with 1 Fixed at 2000 RPM
- [ ] Test Different Wheel Hardnesses and Combinations of Wheel Hardnesses
- [ ] Run the Motor Overheat Tests
- [ ] What is the best overall setup (angle, rpm, wheel hardness)
- [ ] What can be done to decrease spin up and recovery time of the Flywheels


## **Testing**

### **RPM Combination Testing - Test 001 A-U**

For all of these test we will do five shots at each different tested settings with a fresh fully charged battery and a full tank of air. The Camera is posistion 8 feet away from the base line that is in line with the center of the Launcher with the Camera 4 feet in the air.

#### **Inital Take Away**

My inital take away before reviewing footage from this test is that with the left flywheel spinning slower the disc seems to not only go straighter but fly farther than the discs fired with the right flywheel spinning slower. Something I noticed when the right flywheel was spinning slower was that the discs began to shoot out right instantly and began curving to the left, unlike the disc fired with the left flywheel moving slower which caused the disc to curve to the right.

#### **Table of Data**

||Left Flywheel RPM|Right Flywheel RPM|Stable (Y/N)|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Test 001 A|2000|2000|N|
|Test 001 B|1900|2000|N|
|Test 001 C|1800|2000|N|
|Test 001 D|1700|2000|N|
|Test 001 E|1600|2000|Y|
|Test 001 F|1500|2000|Y|
|Test 001 G|1400|2000|Y|
|Test 001 H|1300|2000|Y|
|Test 001 I|1200|2000|Y|
|Test 001 J|1100|2000|Y|
|Test 001 K|1000|2000|Y|
|Test 001 L|2000|1900|N|
|Test 001 M|2000|1800|N|
|Test 001 N|2000|1700|N|
|Test 001 O|2000|1600|Y|
|Test 001 P|2000|1500|Y|
|Test 001 Q|2000|1400|Y|

|Test 001 T|2000|1100|Y|
|Test 001 U|2000|1000|Y|


#### **Take Away**
I noticed that the disc tends to stabalize around when one wheel is spinning at 2000 and the other at 1600. While it does get more stable as one side is decreased, it also tends to veer more and not go as far. The veering is more noticable when the left wheel is spinning faster than the right wheel. The disc is more stabalized as the left wheel is slowed and the right wheel is kept at 2000.


## **End of Entry Thoughts**

We didn't get as much as we wanted to do today done, but we will continue to do a few more test Tuesday, then we can move on to desinging and building intakes. Today however yielded some valuable information on combinations of flywheel speeds that will greatly help us in future designing of launchers.




--------



# **5/31/2022 - _Launcher Testing and Intake Design_**

Today we will continue to do a small amount of final testing on the launcher such as overheat testing, and then we will move on to designing and building an intake prototype.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Overheat Testing for Launcher - (Test 002)
- [x] Test Number of Pneumatic Shots - (Test 003)
- [x] Begin Designing Intake
- [ ] (If time) Begin Building Intake


## **5/31/2022 Testing**

### **Test 002**

Test 002 is going to be focused on figuring out if our motors begin to lose performance due to things such as thermal issues over the span of 2 minutes. This will help us figure out whether or not we will be able to run our flywheels constantly over the full length of the match or if we will have to have the flywheels only cut on when we need to shoot discs.

#### **Test 002 A**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102620185/171196552-35a788d1-b255-4a3f-a739-935a2fd2c38e.png)

Left Flywheel:2000 Right Flywheel:2000 for 2 minutes with no discs

There was little to no change in speed and the motors didn't get much warmer, with the tempurature only varying a few degrees.

#### **Test 002 B**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102620185/171196277-e7cb22c9-ab79-44b9-aabe-4c2dd934689f.png)

Left Flywheel:1500 Right Flywheel:2000 for 2 minutes with discs every 10 seconds

While it does dip down after firing a disc, it does stabalize fairly quickly and we don't lose any performance throughout the test.

### **Test 003**

This test was to figure out how many shots could be realiably gotten on one tank of air with our current pnuematic pusher. This will help us figure out how many shots we could potentially have during a match.

#### **Test 003 A**
When we ran the test with the regulator, we were able to get around 75-80 good shots.

#### **Test 003 B**
When we ran the test without the regulator, we were able to get around 60-65 good shots.

## **Design**

### **Intake Design**
We decided that we would prefer a single motored design over a double motored design. One idea for a duel motored design we had was to create tracks with rubber flappers along the sides that lifted the disc through the robot. A way to make this design use only one motor is to create longer flappers and replace one track with a wall to prevent the disc from falling out.

Another idea we found was an intake system using flex wheels that pushed the disc up through the back of the robot and out the top into the launcher.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We found a lot of valuble information through different tests we ran today. Some test results, like Test 002, varied greatly from our original hypothesis. We were able to get everything we wanted to do done which allows us to move on tomorrow. We plan to continue designing intakes and building a prototype of one or more designs.




--------



# **7/28/22 -  _Returning from break / Returning to planning_**

Today we came back together as a team to planning design ideas and to explore some of the rules that have changed or been updated since the last time we met.

## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Look over the Version 1.1 Game Manual
- [ ] Discuss Possible Robot Ideas
- [ ] (If Time) Begin designing intake


### **Looking over the Game Manual**
* There is now no vertical expansion limit in the endgame - SG5
* No trap limit in endgame - G15

### **End of Entry**

We didnt get majority of our goals done, because we started rather late at night. We were only able to look over the game manual but we will do some more work later in the week. 




--------




# **8/18/2022 - _Beginning Work in Class / First In-Season Team Meeting_**

Today we began working in class on a drive train to mount our prototype intake on, as well as brainstorming and designing an intake for our robot. We also have our first team meeting of the season afterschool for returning members.


## **Goals For Today**

- [x] Begin Building Drivetrain to Mount Prototype intake on
- [x] Begin brainstorming and  a few different prototype intakes
- [x] Figure out teams involving returning members during the meeting
- [ ] The goals for today are to begin building the drivetrain for us to mount a prototype intake on and begin brainstroming a few different 


### **Drivetrain for intake prototype**

*For our drive train we are planning on going with a 4 motor drive train with omni wheels that is 25 Wide and 30 Long. This should mimic the approximate size of our base for our final robot and should allow us to prototype a way to intergrate our Flywheel and intake together after we have designed our intake.*


### **Possible Intake Designs**


#### **Flex Wheel Intake**
One option for a possible intake would be to have multiple rows of flex wheels, with the bottom row of flex wheels being smaller and able to move up and down to accommodate for the height and oriantation of the disc.


#### **Intake Roller Intake**

##### **Row Configuration**
Another option is to use multiple rows of intake rollers that would work similar to the flex wheel intake and would use a mobile bottom row for adaptability.

##### **Column Configuration**
A third option is to use two columns of intake rollers on either side of the intake, with a possible bottom row of intake rollers or flex wheels to help feed the discs into the space between the columns of intake rollers.


### **8/18/22 Meeting Overview**
Today we spent the majority of the day organizing teams with the returning members, our team didn't change at all, but we are looking at the possibility of adding a freshman to our team to give us one more member to help us out and learn about robotics.


### **End of Entry**
Today we accomplished everything we wanted to get done and are very happy with our place right now and moving forward.




-------




# **8/19/22 - _Intake Design_**

Today we found an already built drive train to use for intake prototyping so we are going to use that instead of building one for time purposes. We are also sketching the intake designs before we build them today.


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Contiune brainstorming possible intake ideas
- [x] Sketch out the intake ideas
- [ ] (If Time) Begin Building the intakes


### **Drivetrain For Intake Prototyping**

When we got into class today we were looking for something to use as a testing base and found the base for Rhett and Tyler's Tipping Point robot. We wanted to test how an intake would function while being driven around, so an old base worked perfectly for prototyping. This base is 35 Long and 30 Wide with 6 wheels with only 4 of the wheels being driven by motors.

#### **Images of the Base**

### **New Ideas for Intakes**


#### **Tank Tread Intake**

The tank tread intake works by using tank tread and paddles to pull discs in. The intake is angled slightly upwards with a piece of pelxiglass under the disc to guide it into the launcher.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we were able to Sketch out the intakes and are at a place where we feel that we will be able to begin building intakes on Monday.

# **8/22/2022 - _Intake Prototype Building Begins_**

Today we will begin building the 4 different types of intakes, the first two we will focus on building are the tank tread intake and the flex wheel intake.


## **Goals For Today**

- [x] Begin Building Tank Tread Intake
- [ ] Begin Building Flex Wheel Intake
- [ ] (If Time) Begin Building Intake Roller RC Intake
- [ ] (If Time Begin Building Intake Roller CC Intake


### **Intake Building**

### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we were unable to finish as much as we would like, as we didnt get to start the Flex Wheel Intake but hopefully we will be able to begin that tomorrow as well as continue working on the tank tread intake.




------




# **8/23/2022 - _Intake Prototype Design and Discussion Day 2_**

Today we continued discussing our intake ideas, as well as got a rough idea of teams and showed the new kids the basics of this years game.


## **Goals For Today**

- [x] Continue Discussing Intake Ideas
- [x] Identify Potential Problems with the Different Intake Ideas
- [ ] (If Time) Begin Building our First Prototype Intake


### **Possible Problems with Intake Ideas**

When beginning to build the tank tread intake, we ran into the issue of the vex tank treads being too flimsy for our application and too weak for our ideas. Also, when looking at intake rollers for our intake roller design, we realized that the intake rollers can only work using low-strength shafts, meaning that we wouldn't be able to use high-strength shafts. High-strength shafts are a big priority for us due to the stress the robot might be under during competitions. These discoveries led us to scraping our tank tread and intake roller intake designs and going with the flex wheel intake.


### **Big Issue in Building the Flex Wheel Intake**

When we went to begin building our Flex Wheel Intake we found that we didn't have enough of the VersaHex Adapters to make the intake. We decided to stop there in our venture to build an intake and give ourselves until the next day to think of possible ways that we will be able to circumnavigate the need for VersaHex Adapters in our building of the Flex Wheel Intake.

### **Meeting the New Kids**
We spent the meeting showing the new kids this season's game and telling them about different roles found in teams. We gained a new member, Ari, who we are hoping to show the ropes and help us during the season.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we were unable to start building our intake like we had planned to do, but we were able to learn a lot from our struggles today. We will continue to overcome our challenges in building an intake tomorrow by discussing ways to bypass the need for the VersaHex Adapters while building the intakes.




--------




# **8/24/2022 - _Intake Problem Solving_**

Today we will return to discuss our possible solutions to not having enough VersaHex Adapters to make our intake. We will also begin to build our intake if we have time to.


## **Goals For Today**

- [x] Discuss Solutions to our Problems in Building the Intake
- [ ] (If Time) Begin Building the Intake


### **Possible Solutions**

After looking at how many VersaHex Adapters we have, we found that we have enough to do at most 5 Flex Wheels with adapters in them. We chose to use these 10 Adapters in our larger flex wheels in our intake, which will be the 3" OD Flex Wheels of an undetermined hardness, and for our bottom row of wheels, which will be the 2" OD Flex Wheels of an undetermined hardness. We will insert a 12 tooth pinon in the center hole because it will friction fit in an stay held into place in the wheel. This is the simplest and best solution for solving our issue of not having enough VersaHex Adapters of every Flex Wheel.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we were able to come up with what we believe to be a viable solution to our issue, tomorrow we will hopefully be able to make our last few design decisions on our intake prototype so we can then begin to build our intake prototype.




-------




# **8/25/2022 - _Base Prototype Building Begins_**

Today we began building a new base prototype as we found the old base unfit for our needs. We also met afterschool with the whole team to teach team members about Github who weren't knowlageable with the site.

## **Goals For Today**
- [x] Begin building base prototype
- [x] Show Ari and Rebecca how to use Github

### **Pre-built Base Realizations**

While working with the base, we realized the pre-build base was too specialized for our needs. We aren't able to accurately test the intakes we wanted to as the results would vary from a more basic base or a base specialized to the new game.

### **New Base**

The new base will be a mecanum base that is 12.5' long by 17' wide. It will use a 4-motor drivetrain as that is one of the most universal motor set ups and can be easily altered and coded.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we were able to build the prototyping base and teach members who haven't use Github much, if it all, how to format the notebook. We were also able to teach Ari how we plan to do notebook compared to one from one of last season's team. While a lot of what we learned notebook-wise is from experience, we can try to help Ari understand how notebook works by showing him mistakes from last season and how we are going to fix it this year.



-------




# **8/26/2022 - _Mecanum Base Experimentation_**

Today we began experimenting with the mecanum base we built yesterday.

## **Goals For Today**
- [x] Finish building mecanum base
- [x] Start experimenting with the mecanum base

### **Mecanum Base Testing**
We began experimenting with the mecanum base to test different movements we might have to do during competitions. While we might have some extra weight during competitions that might change how we manuver the robot, we needed to ensure we had the range of motion needed for this season.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to test some of the manuvers we think we might have to do during competitions.



-------




# **8/29/2022 - _Intake Prototyping and GPS Testing_**

Today we are working with the GPS built into the field. We also plan to begin building the flexwheel intake.

## **Goals For Today**
- [x] Experiment with the GPS
- [x] Begin Building Intake

### **GPS Experimentation**

We are using an inertial sensor and a GPS sensor to help with our autonomous code and our skills code. The GPS sensor uses the patterning along the walls to know its placement in the field. The inertial sensor allows us to accuratly use turning degrees and distances, only getting more accurate with the help of the GPS sensor.

### **Intake Building**

We are building another base identical to the previous mecanum base for the intake. We are using the other base for GPS testing and we will be able to test and alter two different things without altering either one, creating less time we have to wait till its built.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to get everything we planned on doing done. We were also able to add sensors to a test bot that should help us code autonomous in the future.


-------



# **8/30/22 - _Intake Prototyping Day 2_**

Today we were able to focus on the prototype for the intake system and the notebook.

## Attendence
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [x] Ari


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Start writing the intake code
- [ ] Write the Game Manual Explanation
- [ ] Start Team Bios

### **Intake Testing**

We started working on the code and the base for the intake. We also tested different angles by hand to see which might be better. We decided that if the disc hits the chain, its likely to go into the high goal, but if it hits the roof of the high goal, it has a low change of going into the goal.

### ****Notebook**

We decided to start another repository to make the proccess of moving the notebook to a more user-friendly site easier down the line. We are organizing everything by month and then creating separate files for each day. We also used the beginning of our meeting to talk about different notebook requirement and what we can do to meet them. 

We realize we forgot to include attendence for our previous entries so we are including attendence entries from this entry forward. This should helps us keep track of who comes to each meeting and what everyone is doing.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to work on the prototype for the intake system and where we plan to aim. We were also able to get a lot done notebook-wise that can help us in the future.





-------




# **8/31/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 3_**

Today we hope to finish the base for our intake as well as Continue to test for autonomous and skills programming, we would also like to begin building our intake if we have time today

## **Attendence**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari


## **Goals for today**
- [x] Finish Base
- [ ] Continue Autonoumous/Skills Testing
- [ ] (If Time) Start Building Intake


### **Intake Base**
We found that the chain would hit the screw heads on the bearing block so we put a spacer in between the sprocket and the bearing block. This will create enough distance between the chain and the screw heads to prevent them from hitting each other. After the base was finished we began testing it to see how it felt to drive and how reliable it was with it being partially chain driven. We chose chain drive because it allowed us to move the motors back and free up space for the intake. After about 5 minutes of driving the chain had snapped on three seperate occasions. We decided to make some ajustments and it fixed our issues. We were able to run more stress tests without anything snapping or breaking. One thing that was observed from the occasions where the chain popped was that the base was still fully functional and driving with only a small loss of precision. From the testing today, we are confident that chain drive will work reliably, if we continue down the same path with out final base. A major takeaway is that even if our chain fails, though we highly doubt it will, our robot isnt completely debilitated.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**
Today we were unable to continue program testing for autonomous and skill or start intake building, but we were finally able to finish the base we will build our intake off of, meaning tomorrow our main goals will be to add coding entries into our notebook and begin building the intake as well as to finish and refine our game entry and team bio entries.




------





# **9/1/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 4_**

Today we are going to start building the intake and write code explanation, as well as, finish and refine our game explantation and team bio entries if we have time to do so today.


## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [ ] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [x] Ari


## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Write Code Explanation
- [ ] Start Building Intake
- [ ] (If Time) Finish and Refine Game Explanation
- [ ] (If Time) Finish and Refine Team Bios


### **Code Explanation**

For the Code Explanation Entries the basic format will be a code block with the description of what in that code block directly under the code block

#### **Mecanum Drive Code**

```cpp
 int turn = Controller1.Axis1.position();
 int power = Controller1.Axis3.position();
 int strafe = -(Controller1.Axis4.position());
```
This code sets the variables for reading the controller joystick values to use in motor control. Orginally when you strafe pushing the joystick right would cause you to strafe left, and pushing the joystick left would cause you to strafe right, which is opposite from what we need. By setting the controller's axis4 to negative, we reverse the baseline program, which allows us to strafe the position the joystick is.



```cpp
int fl = -(power + turn - strafe);
int rl = power + turn + strafe;
int fr = -(power - turn + strafe);
int rr = power - turn - strafe;
```
This code is for determining the amount of power to give each motor based on math using the controller values defined in the first shown code block. The fl and fr equations are set negative because the front left and front right motors spin the opposite direction of the back left and back right motors.



```cpp
leftMotorA.spin(forward, fl, vex::percent);
leftMotorB.spin(forward, rl, vex::percent);
rightMotorA.spin(forward, fr, vex::percent);
rightMotorB.spin(forward, rr, vex::percent);
```
This code spins the motors based on the math done in the previously shown code block allowing the bot to drive based on the controller inputs given.


#### **Intake Toggle On/Off Code**

```cpp
bool lastKnownStateOfButtonIntake = false;
bool shouldIntakeRun = false;
```
This code intitalizes the booleans that will be used to toggle the intake on and off



```cpp
//Intake Toggle On/Off Control

   // check if the button's state is different from its last known state (has there been a change?)
   if(Controller1.ButtonUp.pressing() != lastKnownStateOfButtonIntake){

   //update last know state for next loop
   lastKnownStateOfButtonIntake = Controller1.ButtonUp.pressing();

    //check the new state of the button (what just happened?)
	  if(Controller1.ButtonUp.pressing()){

		//the button was just pressed - time to toggle the variable
		  if(shouldIntakeRun == true){shouldIntakeRun = false;}
        	else if(shouldIntakeRun == false){shouldIntakeRun = true;}

            }else{
        // the button was just released, but we don't care; do nothing
      }
    }
```
This code checks for button presses which would cause changes in the state of the "lastKnowStateOfButtonIntake" boolean to see if the "shouldIntakeRun" boolean needs to be altered from "true" to "false" or "false" to "true" because of a change in the "lastKnowStateOfButtonIntake" boolean caused by the Up Button on the Controller being pressed.



```cpp
//Intake Toggling On and Off Code
if(shouldIntakeRun == true){ //Spins the Motor if shouldIntakeRun is equal to true
      InRollMotor.setVelocity(200,rpm);
      InRollMotor.spin(reverse);
    }
  else if(shouldIntakeRun == false){ //Stops the Motor if shouldIntakeRun is equal to false
      InRollMotor.stop();
    }
    else{
      // If Neither requirement is met do nothing
    }
```
This code uses the "shouldIntakeRun" boolean to turn the intake on if the "shouldIntakeRun" boolean is set to "true" and turn the intake off if the "shouldIntakeRun" boolean is set to "false"


### **End of Entry**

Today we unfortunatly unable to begin building the intake or get our game explanations and team bio written, but we will begin working on the intake tomorrow and hopefully get the team bios and game explanation written at our next meeting on the 6th.




-------




# **9/2/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 5_**

Today we will finally start building our intake that we are prototyping after a lot of consideration on how we were doing this and what exactly we were trying to accomplish in building this intake.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [ ] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [x] Ari


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Start Building the Intake Protype


### **Building the Intake**

The basic idea of this intake is to use flex wheels on a slightly angled ramp to bring the discs up to the launcher. Today in class, Tyler begun building the frame that the intake will be mounted on. 

This was done using 2 pieces of 25-long two wide aluminum angle and 1 piece of 20-long two wide steel c-channel across the top and 1 piece of 25-long two wide aluminum c-channel diagonal. To mount this frame to the base, Tyler used some interesting stand-off placement to acheieve the desired angle of the intake, although a file was needed to enlarge the hole so that the stand-off could better fit. 

The frame of the intake was all we were able to build but the objective next time will be to get the polycarb cut to fit our intake to use it as the ramp and then beginning to build the actual part to intake the discs with flex wheels. 

We decided to mount it at an angle to smoothen the ascent and cause less stress on the intake motors. We put it at a random angle just to test and see if it would work. We plan to test different angles in the future if we find that this angle doesn't work.

#### **Images of the Intake**

### **End of Entry Thought**

Today we were able to finally begin building the intake. The next time we work on the robot we will begin working towards mounting the polycarb and possibly begin building the actual intake with the flex wheels to move the disc.




------




# **9/6/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 6_**

Today we will begin to mount the polycarb for our intake and begin to build the actual part to move the discs using flex wheels if we have time today.


## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [ ] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [x] Ari


## **Goals for Today**

- [x] Work towards mounting the polycarb for the Ramp of the Intake
- [ ] (If Time) Begin the part of the Intake that actually moves disc with flex wheels


### **Building the Intake _(Cont.)_**

We started off the meeting by discussing how the polycarb would fit and warp if connected to the frame. 

Rebecca made the argument that if the polycarb was screwed into the top and bottom on the front of the frame, then there would be a bump in the middle of the polycarb going from left to right because of the standoff protruding from the bottom of the frame. 

Rhett made the argument that if the polycarb was screwed into the top and middle on the front of the frame, then ziptied at the bottom front of the frame, the standoff that is purtruding from the bottom will cause the polycarb to warp.
 
Ari started the meeting by working on the summary of the game explination and worked on endgame design ideas. Rhett drilled holes into the polycarb for screws to attach it to the metal frame and we were able to attach it to the frame before we left.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we weren't exactly able to get the polycarb mounted but we will hopefully get it mounted tomorrow and be able to begin working on the flex wheel rollers for the intake.




-------




# **9/7/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 7_**

Today we are going to finish mounting the polycarb to the ramp and then begin on building the flex wheel rollers to bring the Discs up the ramp


## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [ ] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [x] Ari


## **Goals For Today**

- [x] Mount the Polycarb Ramp
- [ ] Begin Working on the Flex Wheel Rollers


### **Building the Intake _(Cont.)_**

Today we were able to finish mounting the polycarb for the ramp but we were unhappy with how the ramp turned out so instead of our design we have been working towards coming up with a new design idea, our polycarb cracking while trying to mount the ramp so wehen that happened we began looking into other alternatives for our intake design


### **End of Entry Thoughts** 

We ended up having issues with mounting our intake so we are being led to redesign our intake, we believe that the redesign of our intake will make meshing our intake and shooting mechanism together a much easier task.




------




# **9/8/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 8_**

Today we will begin looking at redesign possibilities for our intake and then hopefully begin designing the new intake we are going to build.


## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [x] Ari


## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Begin Redesigning Intake  
- [ ] Work on Game Explanation  
- [ ] Work on Team Bios  
- [ ] (If Time) Begin Building Intake


### **Intake Redesign**

After making little to no progress with our current intake idea, we ultimately decided to completely restart from scratch. After sharing ideas for a bit we came up with a couple concepts that we will mix together to ultimately make a better robot and better design. Our leading intake design right now is different from our original design. We also have a basis for a loader that will push the discs into our launcher. We will go more in depth with these designs as they are being built.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we were able to begin redesigning our intake and we have the basic idea for what we want to do down, and tomorrow we will be able to begin working towards building our new intake design.




-------




# **9/9/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 9_**

Today we will get started on building our intake. We also decided that we wanted to work on the robot some over the weekend, so we will spend part of the day gathering the supplies we will need to work on the intake over the weekend.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Begin Working on the Intake
- [x] Gather Equipment for the Weekend Meetings


### **Intake Redesign Building**

Today we were able to get part of the frame built. We plan to drill holes for the high strength axles on our intake, so we had to plan and mark where we would put then. This gave us a good basis for what we need to take home over the weekend. It also helped us get a good understanding of how the intake should work and how we should build it.


### **Next Meeting**

The team decided that we would like to spend more time on certain things, like the intake that we just redesigned, so we have to make time for it outside of school. We would like to get it done soon to allow for more time in the future to work on other things. The extra meetings might continue if we find that everyone can join them and they prove to be helpful.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Though we didnt get a lot done on the robot today, we were able to get the supplies we need to work on the robot over the weekend. The work we did get done allowed us to gain a better understanding of the intake that we are hoping to build. Tomorrow we will be able to drill out the holes for the high-strength axles, attach the frame to the base, figure out how we can minimize motor usage among the axles on the intake.  




-------




# **9/10/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 10_**

Today we will drill the high-strength axle holes and we will work towards mounting the frame of the intake to the base. We will also be figuring out how to drive the axles, for the flex wheels, that the intake will be on.


## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [ ] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Drill the High-Strength Axle Holes
- [x] Mount the Frame of the Intake to the Base
- [x] Figure out how to Drive the Axles of the Intake


### **Intake Redesign Building _(Cont.)_**

The first thing we did today was drill the holes for the high-strength axles to run through. Then we began working on mounting the frame of the intake to our prototype base, once we got that done, we worked on finding the correct spacing between where our ramp would be and where our flex wheels would be. We were unable to decide on spacing, because our intake had to be hand driven, because we werent finished and hadn't mounted our motors yet. We decided we would come back to figuring out spacing when our intake was closer to being finished. For driving the axles of the intake, we decided that using chain would be our best bet, because it would take up the least amount of space, use the least amount of axles, and we could make it so that our bottom row of intake wheels would be able to index if we found some way to build a tensioner for the chain to stay taught, so it doesn't slip off the sprocket.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

The team is happy with what we had managed to accomplish. We decided that we were done for the day, and that we would return tomorrow to continue working on our intake build.




------




# **9/11/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 11_**

Today we decided that we would spend the day figuring out the bottom row of the intake and how to make it properly move without it going too far and allowing it to index properly.



## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [ ] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari


## **Goals for Today**
-[x] Figure out How to Build the Indexing Bottom Row


### **Intake Redesign Building _(Cont.)_**

For having the bottom row to be able to index we decided on mounting the axle on a piece of c-channel that is attached to a stand-off that is on a shaft-collar-stand-off joint, with the shaft collar joint attached to the robot on a screw joint. We bent the end of the metal into an "L" shape in order to prvent the index from going to high. We used rubber bands that force the stand-off back down, so that there is downwards pressure on the disc when it goes through. This will help the bottom row of wheels return to the point that we want them to rest at. 

_Translation 1_
Having a mobile bottom row would be extreamly useful as it would help pull the disc into the intake. To make the bottom row mobile, we attached a stand-off to a shaft collar and used a screw to attach it to the base. The shaft collar allows it to spin freely and the stand-off allows us to attach it further out from the base. We used rubber bands to help hold it down and make it more precise, allowing it to index, or move more percisely than before. The rubber bands would also add the force needed to pull the disc into the intake and return the row back to its original position. (What's it)

### **End of Entry Thoughts**

We did have to stop before we were able to mount and tension, but we are happy with everything we were able to accomplish and comfortable with how far we got.



-------




# **9/12/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 12_**

Today we will continue working on building the bottom indexing row of the intake, if we finish on the bottom row we might begin to work on building figuring out spacing for the ramp and then work from there.


## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [x] Ari


## **Goals For Today**
- [x] Continue on Intake Bottom Row
- [ ] (If Time) Begin working on Ramp Spacing

### **Intake Redesign Building _(Cont.)_**

While working on the bottom row, Rhett noticed that the intake's bottom row c-channel was unable to fit a high-strength bearing block, though Tyler was able to find a fix for that. We were able to remount the frame on longer metal to allow for trimming in the future, though it does mean we are unable to close the box and are outside the 18. The rubber band for the bottom row was also added in a certain way to give it the right amount of resistance. This allows the disc to move underneath it but force the disc up into the intake at the same time.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we werent able to finish the bottom row for the intake but we made good progress on getting it done. We will hopefully be able to finish it tomorrow and =get to working on the ramp and tensioner tomorrow if we have time.

# **9/13/2022 - _Intake Prototyping Day 13_**

Today we are hoping to finish the bottom row on the intake and, if time permits, begin working on the ramp and tensioner for the bottom row of the intake's chain. We would also like to finish the team bios and game explanation if possible.

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Continue Intake Building
- [ ] Finish Team Bios
- [ ] Finish Game Explanation.

### **Intake Building**
We were able to get the flex wheels on the intake and start on how the motors and chains would interact. We were able to use one motor on the intake by connecting them all together with properly tensioned chains. The original motor was too weak for our use so we switched it out with a high torque motor.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to continue working on the intake, team bios, and the game explanation, though we weren't able to finish both the team bios or the game explanation.

# **9/14/2022 - _Intake Redesign and Prototyping Day 1_**

Today we are going to continue working on the intake to hopefully finish it as soon as we can.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Continue Intake Building

### **Intake Building**

After finding some faults in our current arrangement, we came up with some ideas on how to improve our design.

We found that the current plan for the arrangement of flex wheels wouldn't hit where we need on the disc due to the varying heights. We will either put two in the middle of the bars to only hit the middle of the disc or put them just on the ends of the bars to hit the thicker part of the disc. If we put the two flex wheels on the outside, we might add a track through the center with flappers to help push it up using the inner lip on the disc.

Another issue that came up was the lack of structure on our robot. While certain parts of our robot are structurally sound, most of it can wiggle freely back and forth. We took apart the robot to start with just the intake and working out way down. This will allow us to focus on structuring the base around the intake and help us to make the base structurally sound.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to come up with ideas to improve our robot and identify issues that either currently exist or that may arise in the near future.

# **9/15/2022 - _Intake and Launcher Prototyping Day 1_**

Today we are going to try to finish the intake and start on the launcher.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [x] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Finish Intake Building
- [x] Redesgin Launcher for Mounting on Robot
- [x] (If Time) Start Launcher Building

### **Intake Building**
We are going to attach the lexane to angle brachets on the intake. This will limit the space used by the lexane and leave more room for the launcher.

### **Launcher Redesigning**
The original launcher prototype is too big for the space we have available on our robot, so we have to shrink the overall size of the launcher. We are moving the motors underneath the fly wheel subsystem to save space above the launcher system.

### **Laucher Building**
We started building the gear boxes for the launcher. By starting with the gear boxes, we are able to build the rest of the launcher around the space available after adding them in.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
While we weren't able to get much farther on the intake, we were able to start on the launcher and redesign our prototype beforehand to fit a smaller area.

### **Building Launcher**
We started on the gear boxes yesterday and we plan to finish them today. 

### **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to finish the gear boxes.

- [x] Tyler
- [ ] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Make progress of the intake
- [ ] (If Time) Attach Launcher to Intake

### **Intake Prototyping**
We added flat metal to the top of the intake to help guide the disc into the launcher. The curved edge should push and guide the disc to lay flat in the launcher. We already have plans to change the design of the curved edge, though we want to see if it ends up working first.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to make progress and improvements on the intake.

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Cut and Mount Lexane for the Intake

### **Intake Prototyping**
The lexane was finally able to be cut today. We plan to use it to guide the disc up into the intake and to act as a wall for the disc to push against when in the intake.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
While we ran into a few issues while cutting the lexane, we were able to cut it to the correct size and it was able to be mounted perfectly.

- [x] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari


## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Mount Intake to Launcher
- [ ] Testing Intake for faults


### **Intake Testing**
We found that our redesign of the intake flywheels keeps trapping the disc in the intake. We tried only spacing out the bottom row, which definetly helps, though it gets stuck in the top. In the end, we have the top row and the second to last row spaced out with the middle row together. This prevents the disc from getting stuck and pushes it out the top. 

Another issue we came across was the lack of flex with the lexane. One reason we had so many issues with the top row was how we mounted the lexane. The second to last row had the lexane mounted above it, allowing it to flex around the disc. The top row had the lexane mounted almost parallel to the row, preventing the lexane from flexing properly. We moved the lexane and the top row of screws down a bit, which allows the lexane to flex or push out and away from the intake, hopefully dropping into the launcher.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to get a lot done on the intake and we were even able to start planning how it would mount to the base. We weren't able to mount the launcher onto the intake, unfortunatly. We think the base will have to be built before we can mount the launcher.




-----





# **9/21/22 - _Base Prototyping_**

Today we are working on completing the base prototype and continuing the code. 


## **Attendance**

- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari


## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Redo Base Prototyping
- [x] Continue Programming


### **Base Prototyping**
We decided to redo the base to better incorperate the intake. The original base wasn't structured well and allowed the base to bend and twist. We made the base thinner to attach the intake directly onto the base rather than with standoffs like the previous base.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/192545041-6cbc95ce-25e4-4f6f-b5a9-92fbfe2c44e9.jpg " height = "500">

# **9/22/22 - _Finalizig Prototype Day 1_**

Today we are going to finish up the overall prototype for our robot.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Start coming up with final prototype design.
- [ ] (If possible) Mount Bottom Row of Intake


### **Prototype ajustments**
We widened the base from to allow the mecanum wheels to sit beside sprokets. We are going to use chain drive which requires the sprockets to be attached to the wheels.

### **Checking up on Others**
We walked around and talked to other teams to see where they were in the planning and/or building process. Some teams were running into issues that we were able to try and help with. We were also able to send Rebecca over to help 9623W focus on their work.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to start on finalizing the robot prototype and help out other teams where we could.




-----






# **9/23/22 - _Finalizing Prototype Day 2_**

Today we plan to mount the bottom row and finalize mounting the intake to the base.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Mount Bottom Row
- [x] Continue Team Bios

### **Bottom Row**
The bottom row is spun using the motor from the intake. We attached a sprocket to the second to last row and the bottom row for the chain connecting them together. This should help us save motors and run the whole intake system at the same time.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to get some work done on the team bios and all we are needing now is pictures from everyone. We weren't able to completely mount the bottom row of the intake, but we did get further along in attaching it to the bot.




-----





# **9/26/22 - _Finalizing Prototype Day 3_**

Today we are working on finializing the intake and improving the launcher.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Finalizing Intake
- [x] Continuing Launcher


### **Launcher**
We are adding rotational sensors to the launcher to track the flywheel rpm. This should give us an accurate reading on the flywheels so we can program more accurately.

### **Intake**
The edge of the base sticks out too far for the sprocket on the bottom row to turn comfortably. We are able to cut and shave down the edge to prevent the chain or the sprocket from getting caught.  

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to attach the bottom row to the rest of the motorized intake. We were also able to add the rotational sensors and begin testing code to give us a better idea on how we can use them in the future.




-----





# **9/27/22 - _Finalizing Prototype Day 4_**

Today we are finishing up the intake and fixing errors we found in yesterday's testing code.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [x] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Fixing Code Errors
- [ ] Correcting Tolarences to Finalize Intake
- [ ] (If Time) Start on the Ramp

### **Intake**
The shaft collar on the outside of the wheel is being used to pull the wheel away from the chain and sproket. Over time, we think the shaft collar could wear away the metal, so we added a washer to prevent this. 

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to get a lot talked about during the meeting and we plan to start finishing up the bot for an early competiton. This competition should help us get some ideas on how we can improve our robot and reveal any flaws we might have overlooked.

# **9/28/22 - _Finalizing Prototype Day 5_**

Today we are planning to finally finish up the Intake and test pnuematics pressuring.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Finalize the Intake
- [x] Test Pneumatics
- [ ] Add Code to the Notebook
- [ ] Add Code onto a Seperate File

### **Code**
We are going to add bit of the code Rhett has been working on to the actual notebook, but add a link to a separete file that contains the entire code for people who would like to check it out. This should show how we have been working on the code while allowing people to look at just the code if they are curious on how something works.

### **Pneumatics Testing**
We decided to run some tests to find out if we were able to use a double acting cylinder in the launcher. Unfortunatly, we weren't able to finish it today, so we will finish the tests tomorrow and add them to tomorrow's entry.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to finalize the intake and begin testing different pneumatics systems for the launcher. We plan to continue pneumetics testing tomorrow and begin adding code into the notebook.

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Continue Base prototyping

### **Base Prototyping**
We weren't at school for this meeting due to the hurrican, which prevented us from continuing the pneumatics testing for the launcher. Rhett and Tyler were able to meet up outside of school to work on the base before the hurricane. We were able to get the wheels and motors attached and ready for chain-drive. 

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
While we weren't able to get what we originally wanted done, we were able to work on some things that have been set aside till now, like the wheels.

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Widen the Base

### **Base Prototyping**
When trying to attach a supporting bar onto the bot, the holes on the bars didn't line up with the connecting c-channel. We decided to widen the entire bot by a quarter inch to make up for this issue.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to get the bot widened and improve the structure of our robot.

- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Finish the Bases Drivetrain
- [x] Add Pneumatics Test to Notebook
- [x] Add PROS Code Explanations to Notebook


### **Base Work**
The spacing for our wheels doesnt leave a whole lot of room between different parts. The sprocket for chain drive does fit, though the space is quite tight and doesn't leave much room

### **Pneumatics Test**

We Wanted to Run a test to see if we could use a double acting cylinder as our pnuematics device to conserve space and make a more effective launcher. However we were unsure just how many shots we could get on a double acting cylinder, and if we used a double acting cylinder we would even be able to have enough shots to last the whole match (We figure this to be somewhere between 40 to 50 shots in a match where we have to shoot more discs than usual). To test if we would be able to get enough shots we ran a test to see how many shots we could get on a double acting cylinder with three different setups, without a needle valve limiter, with a needle valve limiter allowing the max amount of air through, and a needle valve limiter allowing just enough air to run the double acting cylinder (This was about half-way open/closed on with the needle valve). With no limiter we averaged 40.8 shots over 10 tests, with a limiter allowing the max amount of air through we averaged 45.3 shots over ten tests, and with a limiter allowing just enough air to run the double acting cylinder effectively we averaged an even 50 shots over 10 tests. These tests lead us to believe that we will be able to use a double acting cylinder for the acutuator for our flywheel, meaning we can save space and make a more effective launcher.

#### **Pneumatics Test Results**

||**No Limiter**|**Unlimited With Limiter**|**Half-way Limited**|

|**Test 10**|40|46|52|
|**Average**|40.8|45.3|50|

### **Preface to Code Explanations**

All of the Code so far has only been tested individualy by itself or has been written to work in theory. All code has not been tested together and may not work as intended. We will be testing the code together and fixing any errors that may arise in the future.


### **PROS Initialization Code**

#### **PROS Device Initialization Code**

```cpp

```
This code initializes all the motors and sensors used in the robot to be able to be called by the PROS API. This code could be easily modified to work with any other motors or sensors that are wanted to be used.


#### **PROS Device Initialization Function Code**

```cpp
void deviceInitialization()
//Device Initialization Function
{
	pros::delay(3000); //Delays the Function by 3 Seconds
	rollerOptical.set_led_pwm(100); //Turns on the Roller Optical Sensor LED at full Brightness
	flywheelActuator.set_value(true); //Moves the Actuator to its Starting Position

	switch(allianceValue)
	//Initializes Devices Based on the Alliance Color selected on the GUI
	{
		case 1: //Initializes GPS for Red Alliance Starting Position
			gps.initialize_full(xRedGPSInital, yRedGPSInital, currentHeading, xGPSOffset, yGPSOffset);
		break;

		case 2: //Initializes GPS for Blue Alliance Starting Position
			gps.initialize_full(xBlueGPSInital, yBlueGPSInital, currentHeading, xGPSOffset, yGPSOffset);
		break;
		
		case 3: //Initializes GPS for Skills Starting Position
			gps.initialize_full(xSkillsGPSInital, ySkillsGPSInital, currentHeading, xGPSOffset, yGPSOffset);
		break;
	}
}
```
This code turns on the optical sensors led and moves the actuator to its starting position. As well as initializes the GPS for the starting position of the alliance selected on the GUI.

lv_style_t labelStyle; //Creates Label Style Variable
```
This code creates all of the variables used in the GUI. This code is written to work with the Auton Selector GUI, but can be easily modified to work with any other GUI.


#### **PROS GUI Button Action Code**

```cpp
static lv_res_t btn_click_action(lv_obj_t * btn)
//Button Press event Function 
{
    uint8_t id = lv_obj_get_free_num(btn); //Gets the ID of the Button that was Pressed

    if(id == 1)
    //If the Red Button was Pressed 
    {
        red = true; //Sets the Red Variable to True
        allianceValue = 1; //Sets the Alliance Value to 1
        lv_label_set_text(selectionLabel, "Red Selected"); //Sets the Selection Label Text to Red Selected
    }

    if(id == 2)
    //If the Blue Button was Pressed
    {
        blue = true; //Sets the Blue Variable to True
        allianceValue = 2; //Sets the Alliance Value to 2
        lv_label_set_text(selectionLabel, "Blue Selected"); //Sets the Selection Label Text to Blue Selected
    }

    if(id == 3)
    //If the Skills Button was Pressed 
    {
        skills = true; //Sets the Skills Variable to True
        allianceValue = 3; //Sets the Alliance Value to 3
        lv_label_set_text(selectionLabel, "Skills Selected"); //Sets the Selection Label Text to Skills Selected  
    }
    return LV_RES_OK;
}
```
This function is called when a button is pressed. It then looks at the ID of the button that was pressed, and sets the appropriate variables to true, and sets the allianceValue variable to the appropriate value. It also sets the text of the selectionLabel to the appropriate text.

#### **PROS Driver Control Drivetrain Control Code**

```cpp
void opDriveControl()
//Driver Control Mecanum Drive Control Function
{
	//Drive Control
	int turn = master.get_analog(ANALOG_RIGHT_X); //Gets the Analog Value of the Right Joystick's X Axis
	int power = master.get_analog(ANALOG_LEFT_Y); //Gets the Analog Value of the Left Joystick's Y Axis
	int strafe = master.get_analog(ANALOG_LEFT_X); //Gets the Analog Value of the Left Joystick's X Axis

	//Maths
	int strafeReversed = -(strafe); //Reverses the Strafe Value
	int fl = -(power + turn - strafeReversed); //Calculates the Front Left Motor voltage
	int bl = power + turn + strafeReversed; //Calculates the Back Left Motor voltage
	int fr = -(power - turn + strafeReversed); //Calculates the Front Right Motor voltage
	int br = power - turn - strafeReversed; //Calculates the Back Right Motor voltage

	//Motor Control

	frDrive.move(fr); //Moves the Front Right Motor at the Calculated Voltage
	brDrive.move(br); //Moves the Back Right Motor at the Calculated Voltage
}
```
This code takes the analog values of the left and right joysticks and uses them to calculate the voltage to send to each motor. This code is written to work with a mecanum drive, but can be easily modified to work with a tank drive or any other type of drive.


#### **PROS Driver Control Intake Control Code**

```cpp
void intakeControl()
//Driver Control Intake Control Function
{
	//Intake On/Off Toggle Variable Control
	
	if(master.get_digital(ButtonUp) != lastKnownStateOfButtonIntake)
	// check if the button's state is different from its last known state (has there been a change?)
	{

		lastKnownStateOfButtonIntake = master.get_digital(ButtonUp); //updates last know state of button for next loop

		if(master.get_digital(ButtonUp))
		//check the new state of the button (what just happened?)
		{

			//the button was just pressed, so toggle the state of the intake
			if(shouldIntakeRun == true)
			{
				shouldIntakeRun = false;
			}
			else if(shouldIntakeRun == false)
			{
				shouldIntakeRun = true;
			}
			else
			{
				//the button was just released, but we dont care, so do nothing
			}
		}
	}

	//Intake Toggle Code

	if(shouldIntakeRun == true)
	//Spins the Motor if shouldIntakeRun is equal to true
	{
		intakeMotor.move_velocity(100);
	}
	else if(shouldIntakeRun == false)
	//Stops the Motor if shouldIntakeRun is equal to false
	{
		intakeMotor.brake();
	}
	else 
	{
		//shouldIntakeRun is neither true nor false, so do nothing
	}
}
```
This code takes the state of the up button on the controller and uses it to toggle the state of the intake. This code is written to work by toggling the intake on and off, but can be easily modified to work with a button that is held down to run the intake.


#### **PROS Flywheel Data Output Code**

```cpp
void RPMValue(int dataInterval)
//Flywheel Data Output Function
{
	leftFlySpeed = (leftFlyRot.get_velocity()/6); //Gets the Speed of the Left Flywheel in RPM
	rightFlySpeed = (rightFlyRot.get_velocity()/6); //Gets the Speed of the Right Flywheel in RPM
	absLeftFlySpeed = abs(leftFlySpeed); //Gets the Absolute Value of the Left Flywheel Speed
	absRightFlySpeed = abs(rightFlySpeed); //Gets the Absolute Value of the Right Flywheel Speed
	std::cout << recordedTime << "," << absLeftFlySpeed << "," << absRightFlySpeed << "\n"; //Prints the Time and Flywheel Speeds to the Console
	pros::delay(dataInterval); //Delays the Function by the Specified Amount of Time
	recordedTime += dataInterval; //Adds the dataInterval to the Recorded Time to track the Time
}
```
This code takes the speed of the flywheel and prints it to the console. This code is written to work with the flywheel motors, but can be easily modified to work with any other motor.


#### **PROS Driver Control Flywheel Control Code**]

```cpp
void FlywheelControl(int leftFlyRPM, int rightFlyRPM)
//Flywheel Control Function
{
	theoreticalRightFlywheelSpeed = rightFlyRPM*10; //Sets the Speed that the Right Flywheel Should Be Going
	theoreticalLeftFlywheelSpeed = leftFlyRPM*10; //Sets the Speed that the Left Flywheel Should Be Going

	if (master.get_digital(ButtonA))
	//Runs the Flywheel at the Specified Speeds and Starts Data output when the A Button is Pressed 
	{
		leftFlyMotor.move_velocity(leftFlyRPM); //spins the left flywheel at the specified speed
		rightFlyMotor.move_velocity(rightFlyRPM); //spins the right flywheel at the specified speed
		spinning = true; //Sets the Variable to output data to true
		flywheelStopped = false; //Sets the Variable to indicate that the Flywheel is Stopped to False
	}

	if (master.get_digital(ButtonB))
	//Stops the Flywheels when the B Button is Pressed 
	{
		leftFlyMotor.brake(); //Stops the Left Flywheel motor
		rightFlyMotor.brake(); //Stops the Right Flywheel motor
		flywheelStopped = true; //Sets the Variable to indicate that the Flywheel is Stopped to True
	}

	if (master.get_digital(ButtonY))
	//Fires the Pnuematic Actuator when the Y Button is Pressed 
	{
		flywheelActuator.set_value(false); //Moves the Actuator to Push the Disc into the Flywheel
		pros::delay(100); //waits 100 milliseconds
		flywheelActuator.set_value(true); //Moves the Actuator to Return the Actuator to its Original Position
	}

	if (master.get_digital(ButtonL1))
	//Increases the Left and Right Flywheel Speeds by 10 RPM When the Left Bumper is Pressed 
	{
		leftFlyRPM += 10; //Increases the Left Flywheel Speed by 10 RPM 
		rightFlyRPM += 10; //Increases the Right Flywheel Speed by 10 RPM
		leftFlyMotor.move_velocity(leftFlyRPM); //Spins the Left Flywheel at the New Speed
		rightFlyMotor.move_velocity(rightFlyRPM); //Spins the Right Flywheel at the New Speed

	}

	if (master.get_digital(ButtonL2))
	//Decreases the Left and Right Flywheel Speeds by 10 RPM When the Left Trigger is Pressed 
	{
		leftFlyRPM -= 10; //Decreases the Left Flywheel Speed by 10 RPM
		rightFlyRPM -= 10; //Decreases the Right Flywheel Speed by 10 RPM
		leftFlyMotor.move_velocity(leftFlyRPM); //Spins the Left Flywheel at the New Speed
		rightFlyMotor.move_velocity(rightFlyRPM); //Spins the Right Flywheel at the New Speed
	}

	if (leftFlySpeed < 1 && rightFlySpeed < 1 && flywheelStopped == true) 
	//Stops data output when the Flywheels stop spinning and the flywheelStopped Variable is True
	{
		spinning = false; //Sets the Variable to output data to False
	}

	if (spinning == true)
	//Runs the Data Output Function when the spinning Variable is True
	{
		RPMValue(25); //Runs the Data Output Function at the specified data interval
	}
	//prints the theoretical flywheel speeds to the controller
	master.print(0, 0, "L: %i", theoreticalLeftFlywheelSpeed, "  |  ", "R: %i" , theoreticalRightFlywheelSpeed);
}
```
This code controls the flywheel motors and the actuator. This code is written to work with the flywheel motors and the actuator, but can be easily modified to work with any other motor or actuator. This code also uses the RPMValue function to output the flywheel speeds to the console as well as uses some code to print the theoretical flywheel speeds to the controller.


#### **PROS Roller Identification Code**

```cpp
void rollerIdentification()
//Roller Owner Identification Function
{
	switch(allianceValue)
	//Identifies whether the Roller is Owned or Not based on the Alliance Color Selected on the GUI
	{
		case 1: //Red Alliance
			if(opticalHue >= 60 && opticalHue <= 270)
			//Identifies the Roller as Red
			{
				rollerOwner = "Red"; //Sets the rollerOwner String to Red
				rollerOwned = true; //Sets the rollerOwned Variable to True
			}
			if(opticalHue >= 0 && opticalHue <= 45)
			//Identifies the Roller as Blue
			{
				rollerOwner = "Blue"; //Sets the rollerOwner String to Blue
				rollerOwned = false; //Sets the rollerOwned Variable to False
			}
		break;

		case 2: //Blue Alliance
			if(opticalHue >= 60 && opticalHue <= 270)
			//Identifies the Roller as Red
			{
				rollerOwner = "Red"; //Sets the rollerOwner String to Red
				rollerOwned = false; //Sets the rollerOwned Variable to False
			}
			if(opticalHue >= 0 && opticalHue <= 45)
			//Identifies the Roller as Blue
			{
				rollerOwner = "Blue"; //Sets the rollerOwner String to Blue
				rollerOwned = true; //Sets the rollerOwned Variable to True
			}
		break;

	}
}
```
This code uses the alliance selected on the GUI to identify whether the roller is owned or not. This allows the robot to know when to stop spinning the roller.


#### **PROS Driver Control Roller Control Code**

```cpp
void rollerControl()
//Driver Control Roller Control Function
{
	if(rollerOwned == false)
	//Spins the Roller if rollerOwned is equal to false
	{
		intakeMotor.move_velocity(25);
	}
	else if(rollerOwned == true)
	//Stops the Roller if rollerOwned is equal to true
	{
		intakeMotor.brake();
	}
	else
	{
		//rollerOwned is neither true nor false, so do nothing
	}
}
```
This code uses the rollerOwned variable to determine whether the roller should be spinning or not. This code is written to work with the intake motor, which also will control the roller mechanism in theory, but can be easily modified to work with any other motor.


#### **PROS Driver Control Parrallel Function Code**

```cpp
void opFunctions()
//Driver Control Parrallel Tasks Function
{
	while(true)
	{	
		#pragma omp parrallel
		//Runs all of the enclosed tasks in parrallel 
		{
			#pragma omp task
			//Defines the enclosed code as a task
			{
				opDriveControl(); //Runs the Driver Control Mecanum Drive Control Function	
			}
			#pragma omp task
			//Defines the enclosed code as a task
			{
				FlywheelControl(160, 200); //Runs the Flywheel Control Function
			}
			#pragma omp task
			//Defines the enclosed code as a task
			{
				intakeControl(); //Runs the Intake Control Function
			}
			#pragma omp task
			//Defines the enclosed code as a task
			{
				rollerIdentification(); //Runs the Roller Identification Function
			}
			#pragma omp task
			//Defines the enclosed code as a task
			{
				rollerControl(); //Runs the Roller Control Function
			}
		}
	}	
}
```
This code runs all of the driver control functions in parallel. This code is written to work with the functions listed, but can be easily modified to work with any other functions, or have functions added to it.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to finish the pneumatics testing and finally add code to the notebook. We also started on the chain drive for the base.

# **10/04/22 - _Testing and Finalizing Intake_**

Today we are working to finish the intake and fix any flaws along the way.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [x] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Finalize Intake
- [x] Test Intake

### **Intake Finalization**
The shaft on the bottom row of the intake was too short for the new width so we had to make a new one of the right length. We were also able to add the ramp to the intake and begin attaching the lexane. 

### **Intake Redesign**
The flywheels at the bottom row prevent the disc from tilting properly into the intake. We are switching the flywheels out for a sprocket and rubberband like the very last row of the intake. The extra elasticity and space should be enough room for the disc to be pushed up into the intake.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to finalize this version of the intake but testing proved that there was still more to be done.

# **10/05/22 - _Intake Building_**

Today we are working on the bottom row of the intake.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Start on Bottom Row Redesign
- [ ] Replace Broken Wires in Battery Case

### **Intake Redesign**


### **Battery Case**
The battery case for our club had a few fraying wires, so we decided to replace the wires to prevent people from getting shocked on the wires.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We werent able to finish fixing the battery case and we will have to continue it tomorrow.




-----





# **10/06/22 - _Intake Redesign and Long Meeting_**

Today we are working to finish the intake and finish replacing the wires in the battery case. We have a long meeting today and we plan to use our time as wisely as we can.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [x] Rebecca
- [x] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Finish Intake
- [ ] (If Time) Mount Launch
- [x] Finish Replacing Wires in Battery Case

### **Intake Ajustments**
The discs were getting caught on the sprockets so we widened the intake to allow space for the disc to fit between the sprockets. We widened it by 4 inches to give the disk some extra space. 

### **Ramp Redesign**
Our old ramp was too steep and prevented the disc from entering the intake properly. We are creating a more gentle ramp that uses the flexability of the rubberbands to push the disc into the intake. The ramp we tested first was a flat ramp with a tight turn into the upper intake. This helped the disc get onto the ramp, but it wouldnt get into the upper intake. We went back to our original curved ramp design after testing multiple different angles as it was much more effective than the tight turn from the lower intake into the upper intake.

### **Team Battery Case**
We decided to replace multiple cables to prevent people from accidently shocking themselves and prevent other cables from degrading further. We also labeled the cables for future repairs. This will help us have back-up batteries prepared for the whole club during competition and easily transport our batteries to and from competition.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We were able to get a lot done today and test a new ramp design. We also got the chance to talk to some of the people who were previously on the team and have since graduated. They were able to help us with ideas on things we could test or things that might not work on our current prototype.

# **10/07/22 - _Intake Redesigning and Notebook Work_**

Today we plan to continue working on the intake after yesterday's redesigning and update yesterday's notebooking with the notes we left yesterday.

## **Attendance**
- [x] Rhett
- [x] Tyler
- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] General Notebook Housekeeping
- [x] Continue Intake

### **Intake Adjustments**
We are replacing the bottom row of the upper intake with altered flex wheels that should help give us a little more rigitity than the rubberband and sprocket row but giving us more flexability than the flex wheel rows.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We weren't able to get a lot done due to the shortened day, but we did fix up the notebook and begin working on the intake redesign.

- [x] Noly
- [ ] Rebecca
- [ ] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Finish Intake System
- [ ] (If time) Start on Ramp

### **Intake System Ajustments**
We are switching out the bottom row of the upper intake with custom cut flex wheels to provide a bit more regitity than the rubber bands but more flexibility than the original flex wheels.

We originally moved the two top rows of the upper intake back by one hole to help with fitting the disc between the lexane from the bottom row. The new bottom row messed up the spacing for this design so we are moving the two top rows forward again to try and fix the spacing for the disc.

### **Launcher CAD**

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We didn't get much done today but we were able to get the two top rows of the upper intake taken off and prepped for tomorrow.

## **Goals for Today**
- [ ] Finish Intake

### **Intake Ideas**
We are using 3 flex wheels for the middle row to help boost the disc up to the top row. We are concerned about the middle flex wheel not touching the disc, so we will cut the two outer wheels to match the already cut ones on the bottom row if this issue occurs. 

We continued to move the intake forward one hole to help the two top rows of the upper intake reach the disc and pull it up

# **10/12/22**


# **10/13/22**

## **Attendance**

- [x] Ari

## **Goals for Today**
- [x] Test Intake
- [ ] Finish Launcher
- [ ] (If Time) Mount Launcher

### **Intake**
With the intake finally completed, we were able to begin testing our intake. We found that the robot wouldn't turn correctly because of the base bowing in the middle. To fix this, we added a supporting bar across the entire robot, attaching it to the inner and outer wheel bars. Before we reattached the lower intake, we tested it to see if we actually needed it or if we could use the space for the launcher or any other things we need. The intake couldn't get to the disc without it so we ended up adding it back on.

## **End of Entry Thoughts**
We weren't able to finish the launcher today but we were able to test the intake and work out any immediate issues.
