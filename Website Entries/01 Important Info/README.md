## ***Game Explanation***
This year the competition is titled VEX: Spin-Up

The field will be divided diagonally into two halves. Robots will be attempting to score discs from the field into the high goals and low goals. There is only 1 high goal and 1 low goal assigned to each allience, with a disc scored in the high goal being worth 5 points and a disc in the low goal being worth 1 point. Teams can use the temporary unlimited horizontal expansion limit in the last 10 seconds to cover as many tiles as possible and earn an additional 3 points for each tile covered. There are a total of 28 tiles on the field, excluding the 8 used for the Low Goals, and both teams can be awarded points for touching the same tile. Each covered tile is worth 3 points. Teams can also use the robots to change the color of the rollers to their assigned alliance color to gain 10 points for each roller owned by their alliance. There are a total of 4 rollars around the field that either alliance can score. Teams can also gain points from the autonomous driving period. Whichever team completes the autonomous period tasks will be awarded the 10 autonomous bonus points.

The match will start with a 15 second autonomous period followed by a driver controlled period lasting a minute and 45 seconds. All game rules are in effect during both the autonomous period and the driver controlled period, though manually driving the bot using the contoller is not allowed during the autonomous period. Teams are given 2 preloadable discs per team before the match and 7 match discs per alliance teams can add onto the field using a metal ramp along the sides of the field. 

During the match, each robot can only hold at most 3 discs at a time. Theres is a vertical and horizontal limit of 18 inches during the match. There is a 24 inch height limit, but its limited to a vertical cylinder with a 2" diameter. This year, teams are not allowed to trap a robot in any way, including blocking a robot from moving on its intended path. Trapping for 5 seconds or more will penalize the team on the offense. Any less than 5 seconds and the opposing team will be given the benefit of the doubt.

The robot can only use 8 motors and 2 pneumatic resivoirs, each capped at 100 Psi. No external tampering with any electronic devices is allowed.

## ***Field Elements***
In Spin Up, there are 4 unique field elements consisting of the High Goals, Low Goal barriers, Rollers, and Discs.

### ***High Goals***
The High Goals can be found in opposing corners of the field and sit on bars attached to the outer walls of the field. They can be found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance scores in each High Goal. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/196198613-301018af-5adb-433d-b4be-32aa60684321.png" height = "250">

Each High Goal has a lower basket with a bar through the middle. The bar holds up a thin, plastic disc that hold the chains, and the chains themselves. These chains are used to help catch the disc and give it a better chance at making it into the basket. 

The High Goal itself only sits at 14.1". The supporting bar defintily add a new level of difficulty to the game as the bar sits 18.5" above the field. This added height lifts the base of the lower basket to 21.4" off the field.. The outer lip of the basket sits roughly 25" above the field with the highest point of the High Goal contraption sitting 35.5" off the field.

These goals are made for robots to shoot discs into the lower basket and gives 5 points for each disc sucessfully landed into the basket.

### ***Low Goals***
The Low Goals can be found under each High Goal and uses a slightly raised ramp to separate the goal area from the rest of the field. The two ramps are found in two colors, red and blue, to designate which alliance scores in each Low Goal. Each alliance's Low Goal is located under the opposing alliance's High Goal. 

Each Low Goal consists of a ramp and a small portion of the field blocked off within that ramp. The ramp sits with an incline towards the outside of the Low Goal, allowing robots easy access out of the goal but difficulty getting in.

The Low Goal ramps are roughly a little more than 1 tile wide on each side in an L shape, hugging the corner of the outermost tile. The Low Goal area only takes up 4 tiles underneath the High Goal.

The way these goals are set up allows missed shots into the High Goals to become points for the opposing teams. Each disc into this goal is only 1 point. The 8 total tiles for the Low Goal are excluded in the scoreable tiles for the End Game.

### ***Rollers***
The Rollers can be found in the two corners unused by the High Goals. They sit on the outer walls of the field and they spin between red and blue, a color for each alliance. There are a total of 4 rollers, which are all identical.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/196445931-16101aba-ba2a-4913-9eec-9a51deab7cd0.jpg" height = "250">

Each Roller has a spinning tube colored half blue and half red. The plastic parts on either side hold the Roller to the wall and allow the tube to spin. The tubes have two bolts in the middle of each color on the far left and right of the tubes. The arms on either side of the plastic pointing towards the tube catch on the bolts. This system helps teams who are able to push the Roller hard enough to catch between these arms and prevent other teams who don't have that strength from switching it to another color.

The tube of the Rollers is 9.80". The outer plastic walls holding the tube to the wall make the entire Roller 13.15". The middle of the Roller sits 13.85" above the field, with the highest point reaching 15.23" above the field. Each Roller sits 2.85" from the wall.

These Rollers allow teams to gain 10 points if their color is shown between the arms. Some teams won't have the mechanics needed to spin the Rollers, giving the teams that do an advantage. It can give teams with stronger contraptions an even bigger advantage to other teams that can't spin the roller hard enough to push the bolt under the arms.

### ***Discs***
The Discs are found scattered across the field. They can be moved around on the field and are only found in one color: yellow. Both alliances are able to pick up and use all of the discs no matter where they are on the field, as long as the robots can reach them. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93736394/196459608-e61025e5-7a79-4dd0-bb37-9aabb23c3a00.png" height = "250">

Each Disc is a flat circle with a raised lip around the edge. Robots can pick them up and fling them at High Goals, or toss and/or push them into Low Goals to score them. Each robot can only hold 3 discs at a time and more discs can be added through the Loader at any time in the match. 

The Discs have a total diameter of 5.51" with a +-0.13" tolerance. Each Disc has a total width of 0.79" with a +-0.02" tolerance.

The Discs by themselves won't earn any points, but they can be used to score points in the two different goals.
