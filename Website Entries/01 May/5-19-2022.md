## **5/19/2022 - _Designing a Test_**

Today we will work on coming up with a test to test the different RPMs that we could run the launcher at so that we can figure out what the most optimal RPM for the flywheels are. We will also work to come up with a gear ratio that we think will impact the speed of the flywheels after a disc is launched the least and that will get us to all the different RPMs we want through chaning the code.


### **Goals for Today**

- [x] Come up with a test that we can use to Test the different RPMs for the flywheels
- [x] Come up with requirements for a gear ratio to use with the test


#### **The Test**

For our test we will start out at 600 RPM for each motor and then gradually increase the RPM of each motor by intervals of 100 each time up to 6000 rpm, for each different rpm we will shoot ten discs and average their distance together for our data entry, each set of ten will be done with a fully charged battery and a full cylinder at 100 psi, this test will give us a good base line for how each different RPM combination preforms and then we will be able to test the RPMs with the best result with the different flex wheel hardnesses to figure out what hardness will work the best, we might also look at combining different hardnesses of Flex Wheels.


#### **Gear Ratio to Test With**

For a Gear Ratio to test with we were thinking about using a 1:10 gear ratio potentially using 5 gears, we chose to use 5 gears because it would transfer less energy to the motor, which means less wear on the motor as well as the motor will be able to spin back up to speed faster, which means we can shoot at a faster rate. This Gear Ratio will allow use to get all of the speeds we want for the flywheels with one gear ratio and the use of selecting the speed in the code. We will work to design a Gear Ratio that fits these requirements tomorrow.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Althought we didn't do much today, today's discussion about what the test should look like and what kind of gear ratio we think would work the best, this discussion helped us layout how our next week or so will look and what we need to do to test everything properly and get the best idea of what will be most effective for our launcher on our robot when we begin buildin
