## **5/24/2022 - _Programming and Working Towards Finalizing the Prototyping/Test Bed_**

Today we will work on getting a program that reliably collects data from the rotational sensors on the flywheels. Once that is done we will begin to try and finalize our design for the test bed so that we can begin testing.

### **Goals for Today**

- [x] Get the Program for the Test Bed Written
- [x] Begin Working towards finalizing the design of the prototyping bed
- [ ] (If Time) Begin Testing


### **Finalizing the Testing/Prototyping Bed Design**

#### **The Pnuematic Pusher**

We decided to redesign the pusher on our pneumatic piston because the old one was causing the disc to be pressed down in the back which popped the front of the disc up instead of the disc being pushed straight through the flywheels like intended

#### **The Bed**

##### **Flexing Issues** 

There was alot of flexing in the c-channels that held our gear ratios and had our motors and flywheels mounted to them, this flexing was causing deflection in the flywheels whenever attempting to fire a disc, to fix this issue of flexing we opted to add another base plate the is screwed in between the bottom c-channels, this made our rig very rigid and almost completely prone to any kind of flexing.


##### **Disc Hitting the Flywheels too low**

Our discs were coming through the flywheels towards the bottom which was causing the flywheels to try and ride over the disc, instead of raising the whole base plate or lowering the flyhweels we opted to add 3 layers of plexiglass for the disc to rest on so that the discs would ride up higher and be pushed through the middle of the flywheels instead of almost under the flywheel. To keep from having to raise everything on the back of the test bed up we decided to mount the pusher device higher in relation to the height of the piston so that it wouldn't have to be moved up.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we began working on finalizing the design of our prototyping bed which means that we are getting close to being able to test our first type of flywheel system and begin to gather data on what will work and what won't work.
