## **5/23/2022 - _Programming and Maybe Testing_**

Today we will look at getting a program written for our prototyping bed that will output the RPMs of the flywheels to an array so we can import the data into a spredsheet and look at a graph of how the disc going through the flywheels affects the RPM of the flywheel and how long it takes the flywheels to get back up to full speed. Once this is done we will potentially be able to start testing. However we might run out of time and not be able to begin testing today.


### **Goals for Today**

- [ ] Write a Program for the test bed
- [ ] (If Time) Collect the Data from the Program and graph it
- [ ] (If Time) Begin testing


### **What The Program should be able to do**

The Program for the test bed should be able to have the flywheel speed be able to be independantly controlled with a controller and be able to fire a disc with the press of a button on the controller by acuating a pnuematic piston. This code also needs to be able to output the speed of the flywheels to an array that expands as much as needed.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today we weren't able to get the program working but we will begin with that tomorrow and hopefully be able to get a program that will allow use to visualize the data recieved from the encoders on the flywheels.
