## **5/20/2022 - _Gear Ratios_**

Today we are going to took at all the different gear ratios and come up with a compound gear ratio that can get us up to our desired RPM target, this Gear Ratio may only be for testing and we come up with a gear ratio that puts us closer to our ideal RPM for our flywheels or this gear ratio may be implemented into our actually launcher if it performs well enough.


### **Goals For Today**

- [x] Make a Table of all Possible Simple Gear Ratios
- [x] Look at all 1:10 Compound Gear Ratios
- [x] Pick a Gear Ratio out of the different possible 1:10 Gear Ratio

### **1:10 Gear Ratio Chosen for Prototyping bed**

When I got into class Tyler and our other friend Alex who is helping us with this bed had been working on it and had decided on a 1:10 Gear Ratio that used a 48T Gear Driven by the motor to a 24T Gear on an axle with a 60T Gear that was driving a 12T Gear. This Gear Ratio was chosen because it gives us a ceiling of 6000 RPM and will allow us to test a wide range of different RPMs. We chose 6000 RPMs as our ceiling because of tests I've seen online that use 3000 RPM Flywheels that are unable to consistently score from the opposite side of the field which gives me an estimate that the ideal gear ratio will be somewhere around 4500 RPM but may be higher than that or maybe even lower than that.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Today I'm happy with what we got done and we will hopefully be able to get a program written on Monday and begin testing either Monday or Tuesday to get our Results and begin to test other things, our test will most likely be done 3 times for each type of flywheel system so that we can test the best hardness of the flex wheels for each flywheel type.
