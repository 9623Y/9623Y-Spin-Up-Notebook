## **5/12/2022 - _Beginning Design_**

Today we will begin working on concept designs of the possible designs that were mentioned last night. First we will do a diagram of how the flywheel system should work in theory, then we will begin to design the launchers more indepth in Fusion 360, so we will be able to build the launchers physically easily because we can just copy the in-depth designs from Fusion 360.


### **Goals for Today**

- [x] Diagram how the 2L1R system will work
- [x] Diagram how the 2L0R system will work
- [x] Diagram how the 1L1R system will work
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 2L1R system in Fusion 360
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 2L0R system in Fusion 360
- [ ] (If time) Begin desinging the 1L1R system in Fusion 360


### **Diagrams of the Different Possible Flywheel Systems**

In the diagrams the black arrows represent the direction of spin of the flywheels(the grey circles), while the red arrows represent the effect that the flywheels had on the disc(yellow circles). In the case of the black arrows, the larger the arrow the faster the flywheels are spinning. In the case of the red arrows, the larger the arrow the greater the effect the flywheels are having on the the disc.

### **End of Entry thoughts**

Today I was able to get the Diagrams for each type of flywheel system made and put it to the notebook, however I ran out of time to begin working on the in-depth designs of each flywheel system because I was helping with the creation of a Fusion 360 library that has every VRC legal part in it as well as every size piece of metal available. This parts library is to help save our robotics teams time when they model their robot in CAD.
