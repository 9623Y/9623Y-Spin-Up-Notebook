## **5/17/2022 - _Design Continues and Building Begins_**

Today we are going to have the first meeting since the build and design contest began meaning that we will able to begin to build our prototype launchers today. However before the meeting today I'm going to try and design the rest of the prototype launcher before we have our meeting today. If I'm able to get the design finished in Fusion before the meeting we will be able to easily build the prototype and possibly begin coding today. When I(Rhett) got  into class today I began to talk with Mr.Holmes about the next step, he said before we begin to work on a launcher we should do tests to figure out what the best rpm to launch the discs at are and make tables to show that data, instead of just designing off of what we guess will work the best. He also suggested to use blue gearboxes for the motors so we would need less of a gear ratio to get to our target rpm to reduce friction in between the gears. So instead of finsihing the design for the launcher we began working on a prototyping bed to run our tests on.


### **Goals for Today**

- [x] Begin Designing a prototype bed in Fusion
- [x] Begin Prototyping
- [x] (If time) Program the Prototype

### **Designing of the Prototyping Bed**

#### **The Base for the 1L1R prototype**

The Base is made up of a 15x30 Steel Base Plate and two 1x2x1x30 Aluminum C-Channels and held together by 8 #8-32 x 1/4" screws with Nylock Nuts on them. We chose to use nylocks so that the basee would be sturdy enough so that it would be able to produce consistent tests while we try different rpms to fire the discs at. This Base is going to be the foundation for all the test we do with the 1L1R System  to find what the best RPM for the flywheels to run at is. Two of these bases can belinked together to get the base used for the 2L1R Prototype.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**

Overall today was very productive and I feel like we mad great progress on our prototyping bed, tomorrow we will hopefully be able to finish designing the beds and get them put together so that we can begin testing either tomorrow or Thursday. I think that these prototypes and test will be very helpful to our final design because it will allow up to go into beginning our design for the launcher on our robot knowing what works and what the best format for the launcher will be.
