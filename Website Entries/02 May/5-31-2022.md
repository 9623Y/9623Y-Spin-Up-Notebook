## **5/31/2022 - _Launcher Testing and Intake Design_**

Today we will continue to do a small amount of final testing on the launcher such as overheat testing, and then we will move on to designing and building an intake prototype.


### **Goals for Today**

- [x] Overheat Testing for Launcher - (Test 002)
- [x] Test Number of Pneumatic Shots - (Test 003)
- [x] Begin Designing Intake
- [ ] (If time) Begin Building Intake


### **5/31/2022 Testing**

#### **Test 002**

Test 002 is going to be focused on figuring out if our motors begin to lose performance due to things such as thermal issues over the span of 2 minutes. This will help us figure out whether or not we will be able to run our flywheels constantly over the full length of the match or if we will have to have the flywheels only cut on when we need to shoot discs.

##### **Test 002 A**

Left Flywheel:2000 Right Flywheel:2000 for 2 minutes with no discs

There was little to no change in speed and the motors didn't get much warmer, with the tempurature only varying a few degrees.

##### **Test 002 B**

Left Flywheel:1500 Right Flywheel:2000 for 2 minutes with discs every 10 seconds

While it does dip down after firing a disc, it does stabalize fairly quickly and we don't lose any performance throughout the test.

#### **Test 003**

This test was to figure out how many shots could be realiably gotten on one tank of air with our current pnuematic pusher. This will help us figure out how many shots we could potentially have during a match.

##### **Test 003 A**
When we ran the test with the regulator, we were able to get around 75-80 good shots.

##### **Test 003 B**
When we ran the test without the regulator, we were able to get around 60-65 good shots.

### **Design**

#### **Intake Design**
We decided that we would prefer a single motored design over a double motored design. One idea for a duel motored design we had was to create tracks with rubber flappers along the sides that lifted the disc through the robot. A way to make this design use only one motor is to create longer flappers and replace one track with a wall to prevent the disc from falling out.

Another idea we found was an intake system using flex wheels that pushed the disc up through the back of the robot and out the top into the launcher.

### **End of Entry Thoughts**
We found a lot of valuble information through different tests we ran today. Some test results, like Test 002, varied greatly from our original hypothesis. We were able to get everything we wanted to do done which allows us to move on tomorrow. We plan to continue designing intakes and building a prototype of one or more designs.
