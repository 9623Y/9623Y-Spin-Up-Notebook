## **5/16/2022 - _Fusion Design Begins_**

Today, Me(Rhett) and Tyler, are going to begin designing our prototype launchers in Fuison. The First Design we will do in Fusion is the 2L1R Launcher, then we will move on to the 2L0R and 1L1R Launchers if time allows today. The main Goal today is to get the 2L1R Launcher fully built in Fusion so that we can hopefully get it completely built in one team meeting tomorrow then we can begin on the other two designs.


### **Goals for Today**

- [x] Begin to Design the 2L1R Launcher in Fusion
- [ ] (If time)Begin to design the 2L0R Launcher in Fusion
- [ ] (If time)Begin to design the 1L1R Launcher in Fusion


### **Designing of the 2L1R Launcher**

#### **The Ramp**

The Ramp is made of 3 1x5x1x22 Steel C-Channels and 2 1x2x1x22 Alumnium C-Channel being is held together by 32 Star drive #8-32 x 1/4" screws with Nylon Nuts on them. We chose this design because the 5 wide C-Channels allow for enough space for the disc and flywheels and the 2 wide C-Channel gives a place to mount the flywheels and motors with a gear ration on.

#### **The Flywheels and their Gear Ratios**

For the Gear Ratio we are using a 1:10 Ratio with at Green Motor. We chose this Ratio because we will be able to dial back the speed from the full speed to the target speeds of 1600 and 1500 RPM and because the motors aren't running at full force they will be under less strain meaning they are less prone to overheatings, and with the two different sides of the flywheel system spinning at different speeds, because we are tuning the speed of the motor down with the code, we can use the same gear ratio on both sides, this will also make it easier to sync up the motors if we want to be able to control the speed of the flywheels mid match.

##### **Diagram of the Gear Ratio for the Flywheels**

##### **Further explaination of the Gear Ratio**
Both sides will have the same gear ratio but on the left side where there is two motors, following the 12 tooth pinion gear in the 1:5 ratio a series of 1:1 ratios will continue that motion to the second flywheel. This means that the Flywheel system only needs 2 motors instead of 3 meaning we have 1 motor to allocate else where.


### **End of Entry Thoughts**
I was unable to get the 2L1R Launcher Fully Designed in Fusion today, I'm hoping to be able to finish it tomorrow morning before we meet for Robotics, today was very productive however as we were able to figure the Gear ration for the flywheels and have come up with a game plan of how to design it.
