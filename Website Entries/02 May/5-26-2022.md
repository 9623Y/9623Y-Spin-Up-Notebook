## **5/26/2022 - _Testing Begins_**

Today we're gong to finish converting our test bed to high strength axles. Once we finish converting the test bed we can begin testing and collecting data on rpm values and how long the flywheel takes to get back up to the set rpms after a disc is launched through it.

## **Goals For Today**

- [x] Convert test bed to high strength axles.
- [x] Collect data on different rpm values.
- [x] Measure and record how long it takes for the flywheel to get back up to speed after a disc is fired

### **Analysis of Data**


##### **Test 1 Graph**

Looking at the graph it's apparent that the flywheels take around 2 seconds to spin up to our desired rpms. After the desired rpm is reached it tends to fluctuate above or below our target speed by up to 50 rpm. 

#### **Test 2 Graph**

In this test we reduced the speed of the left flywheel to create a horizontal disc spin to prevent wobble and make shots more accurate. The left flywheel is spinning at 1500 rpm while the right is spinning at 2000 rpm. The left motor didn't take as long to reach it's full speed but the diffrence seems almost negligible. When we shot a disc through the flywheel the right one lost more speed, losing around 600 while the left motor lost around 250. The recovery time was also much shorter on our left flywheel, being around half a second while the right flywheel took around a second to recover. While I expected there to be a diffrence in the rpm loss and recovery time was to be expected, it was a surpise to me that the diffrence in numbers was that large.

### **End Of Entry Thoughts**

The data we are collecting today is crucial for the design of our bot and the overall outcome of our team this season. I'm glad we are figuring this data out now to implement on the bot later. I'm very happy with the test bed and the kind of crucial data it's been able to provide us. Now that we've finished designing the test bed, we can run all the different tests we need to collect even more data that will help in the designing of our bot. Tests we'll be running are things like what hardness of flex wheels is best for distance and accuracy, how combinging wheels affects our results, what kind of grarbox/rpm is optimal for our goal, what the best angle to shoot from is and what can be done to reduce time required to get the flywheel back up to speed.
